//! Shared WebSocket-test driver.
//!
//! Drives a [`WebSocketScriptRenderer`] through the canonical sequence a scripted
//! WebSocket fixture takes:
//!
//! 1. `render_test_open` — language-native test header.
//! 2. `render_connect` — open WS connection (`let conn = client.connect_websocket(path)`).
//! 3. For each scripted message:
//!    - `direction = send` → `render_send_text` / `render_send_json` / `render_send_binary`.
//!    - `direction = receive` → `render_expect_text` / `render_expect_json` / `render_expect_binary`.
//! 4. `render_close` — close the connection with the expected close code.
//! 5. `render_test_close` — closing brace / `end`.
//!
//! The fixture schema for WebSocket scripts lives in `fixtures/websocket*.json` —
//! see the SSE/WS subset in `crate::fixture::HttpFixture` (currently the WS
//! schema is loaded as raw JSON; a typed schema will be introduced in a follow-up
//! once the language renderers are in place and we know exactly which fields
//! they consume).
