## [Unreleased]

## [0.15.67] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **alef-e2e (typescript/vitest.config.ts.jinja)**: add `testTimeout: 30000` so HTTP
  fixture tests against mock-server do not time out on slow ARM Linux CI runners (Vitest
  default is 5 s).
- **alef-scaffold (swift.rs)**: write `Sources/{module}/{module}.swift` stub so SwiftPM
  can register the `.library` product; without a source file in the target directory
  `swift test` fails with "product not found in package".

## [0.15.66] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **alef-readme (performance_context.jinja)**: emit a blank line between the
  performance metadata line (`**Platform** · function · note`) and the
  benchmark table that follows. Without the blank line, `rumdl fmt`
  (Markdown formatter, used by downstream repos that lint the generated
  READMEs) auto-fixes `MD058` (Missing blank line before table) and the
  `git diff --exit-code` README freshness check in CI then fails. Reported
  via kreuzberg-dev/html-to-markdown CI Lint.

## [0.15.64] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **alef-codegen (magnus hash constructor)**: stop emitting `TypeName::default()`
  for `TypeRef::Named` fields that lack an explicit `typed_default`. Magnus-
  wrapped structs (`#[magnus::wrap]`) do not implement `Default`, so the
  generated Ruby binding failed to compile with `E0599: no function or
  associated item named 'default' found for struct 'FunctionDefinition'`
  (likewise `FunctionCall`, etc.). The hash constructor now treats such fields
  as required: when the caller does not provide the field, the constructor
  returns `magnus::Error::new(ruby.exception_arg_error(), "missing required
  field: ...")` instead of synthesising a fictional default.
- **alef-e2e (swift)**: fix `Package.swift` for path-based local dependencies
  under SwiftPM 6.0. Previously the codegen emitted
  `.package(name: "<ModuleName>", path: ...)` paired with
  `.product(name: "<ModuleName>", package: "<ModuleName>")`, but SwiftPM 6.0
  ignores `.package(name:)` for path-based dependencies and infers the package
  identity from the path's last component (e.g. `packages/swift` → `swift`).
  The generated `Package.swift` therefore failed with
  `error: 'swift': product 'LiterLlm' required by package 'swift' target
  'LiterLlmE2ETests' not found in package 'LiterLlm'`. The codegen now drops
  the redundant `name:` parameter and references the inferred identity in the
  product dependency.
- **alef-e2e (kotlin)**: emit `java` plugin alongside `kotlin("jvm")` in the
  generated `build.gradle.kts`. Under Gradle 9.x, `kotlin("jvm")` no longer
  implicitly applies the `java` base plugin, so the `test` task did not exist
  and `gradle test` failed with `Task 'test' not found in root project
  'kotlin'.` Applying `java` restores the standard test/check lifecycle.

## [0.15.63] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **alef-backend-magnus**: rename generated RBS type alias from
  `instance` to `value` in unit-variant enum stubs. `instance` is a
  reserved keyword in RBS (it refers to the "instance of self" type),
  so `rbs >= 4.0` rejected the generated `sig/types.rbs` with a hard
  parse error that aborted the entire RBS environment load. Downstream
  projects running `steep check` or `rbs validate` saw every unrelated
  RBS — `ActiveRecord::Base::ClassMethods`, `ActiveSupport::Concern`,
  `SimpleDelegator`, etc. — become "Cannot find type". Reported in
  kreuzberg-dev/html-to-markdown#360.

## [0.15.62] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **alef-backend-dart**: support per-target Cargo dependency overrides via
  `[[crates.dart.target_dep_overrides]]` in `alef.toml`. Each entry specifies
  a `cfg` predicate, the `features` to enable on the core dep for that
  target, and optionally `default_features = false`. The emitted
  `Cargo.toml` wraps the base core dependency in `[target.'cfg(not(...))'.dependencies]`
  and emits a matching `[target.'cfg(...)'.dependencies]` block per override.
  Required for projects like kreuzberg where the Android x86_64 emulator
  triple cannot link ORT prebuilts and must fall back to a no-ORT feature
  group, while arm64 Android phones and all other targets keep the full set.

## [0.15.61] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **alef-backend-ffi**: add `noop_method_call` to the crate-level
  `#![allow(...)]` block in the generated `lib.rs`. The trait-bridge async
  dispatch emits `let result = result.clone();` on `&[&str]` slices — a no-op
  since slices don't implement `Clone`. Cargo's `[lints.rust]` table doesn't
  override `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings`, but a file-level inner attribute does.
- **alef-codegen/doc_emission**: take the exception class name as a parameter
  in `emit_phpdoc` and `emit_csharp_doc` instead of hard-coding
  `"KreuzbergException"`. PHP and C# backends now thread the project-specific
  exception type through `<exception>` / `@throws` doc emission so
  kreuzcrawl-style projects no longer see `<exception cref="KreuzbergException">`
  on their generated bindings.
- **alef-e2e/swift**: derive the test target name from the configured module
  (`{module_name}E2ETests`) in both the rendered `Package.swift` and the
  emitted test file directory. Previously hard-coded to `KreuzbergE2ETests`
  regardless of project, which broke kreuzcrawl's swift e2e build.
- **alef-backend-php**: unmask `core_import` parameter on `gen_static_method`
  (renamed from `_core_import` in 0.15.61 WIP) so `Exception` class derivation
  compiles. Fixes a clippy/cargo-check break introduced alongside the
  exception-name refactor.
- **alef-cli**: `alef all --format` now accepts the flag without an explicit
  value (matches the `alef generate --format` UX). Defaults to `true`; pass
  `--format=false` to opt out.

### Internal

- Refresh insta snapshots in `alef-backend-swift` for the cargo-machete
  metadata block and crate-root clippy allows added in 0.15.58.
- Sync `tests/integration_test.rs` and `tests/field_path_array.rs` with the
  current `wrap_return_with_mutex` and swift optional-chain accessor
  behaviour (`&&str` → `to_string()`, `()?[N]` without trailing `?`).
- Drop the outdated `texts:` named-arg assertion in
  `dart_scalar_array_arg.rs` — the dart codegen forces positional args for
  scalar-element json_object types.

## [0.15.60] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **alef-e2e/swift**: actually move generated tests to `<output>/swift/Tests/KreuzbergE2ETests/`.
  The 0.15.59 release renamed the test target but left `tests_base` pointing at
  `output_base.join(pkg_path)` (which normalises to `packages/swift`), so the
  files still landed under `packages/swift/Tests/`. Use `output_base` directly
  and drop the now-unused `normalize_path` helper. Same Package.swift output
  as 0.15.59, just the test files now live where intended.

## [0.15.59] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **alef-e2e/swift**: generate Swift e2e tests into `<output>/swift/Tests/KreuzbergE2ETests/`
  (mirroring every other language) instead of `packages/swift/Tests/`. The previous
  layout claimed SwiftPM 6.0 forbade inter-package `.package(path:)` references —
  not actually true; the real constraint was implicit package identity. The generated
  `e2e/swift/Package.swift` now declares an explicit
  `.package(name: "Kreuzberg", path: "../../packages/swift")` so SwiftPM resolves the
  binding library correctly. Downstream `alef.toml` `[crates.test.swift]` blocks can
  now point `e2e` at `cd e2e/swift && swift test`.
- **alef-e2e/c**: only emit the mock-server orchestration block in the generated
  `Makefile` when at least one fixture actually `needs_mock_server()`. Previously
  every C e2e suite hard-required `../rust/target/release/mock-server` regardless
  of whether any fixture defined `mock_response`/`http` shapes, breaking C FFI
  CI for repositories whose fixtures never exercise HTTP (e.g. html-to-markdown
  where 0 fixtures need a mock backend). Suites with mock-needing fixtures get
  the same behaviour as before.

## [0.15.58] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **alef-cli**: `alef readme` now includes Rust in the regeneration loop when
  `[crates.readme.languages.rust]` is configured in `alef.toml`. Previously the
  command called `resolve_languages` which excluded Rust (matching the policy
  for binding generation), so the Rust crate's `crates/<lib>/README.md` was
  silently skipped and stayed frozen — drifting the moment templates changed.
  Introduces a dedicated `resolve_readme_languages` helper that mirrors
  `resolve_doc_languages` (Rust is the source language; its crates.io README
  needs the same regen path as every binding's README). Opt-in via the existing
  `[crates.readme.languages.rust]` block in `alef.toml`.

### Fixed

- **alef-e2e/swift**: coalesce `.len()` via `?? 0` when emitting `not_empty` /
  `is_empty` assertions over a `?.` optional-chain accessor. Previously the
  generator emitted `XCTAssertGreaterThan(result.field()?.inner().len(), 0, ...)`
  which Swift rejects with `cannot convert value of type 'UInt?' to expected
  argument type 'Int'` because optional chaining propagates `?` through the
  whole expression. The not_empty / is_empty arms in
  `crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/swift.rs` now check `accessor_is_optional` (the
  same heuristic already used by every other assertion arm) and wrap as
  `(field_expr.len() ?? 0)` when the chain crosses an optional field. Surfaced
  in kreuzcrawl's swift test target where `result.markdown()?.content().len()`
  failed to compile across MarkdownTests.swift.
- **alef-backend-swift**: emit `[package.metadata.cargo-machete] ignored =
  ["async-trait", "serde"]` in the swift-bridge Cargo.toml. Those deps are
  conditionally referenced (only when the umbrella crate declares trait
  bridges or `Serialize`/`Deserialize`-derived response types); downstream
  consumers without those features (kreuzcrawl) saw cargo-machete false-
  positive flags. Ignoring at the manifest level keeps the manifest stable
  across regens.
- **alef-backend-swift**: allow `clippy::useless_conversion` and
  `clippy::inherent_to_string` at the crate root of the emitted swift-bridge
  Rust crate. The bytes-default `__target.x = x.into();` is a no-op when
  source and target field types match (kreuzcrawl `Option<Vec<u8>>`), and the
  emitted `RustString` wrappers ship inherent `to_string(&self)` that clash
  with Display::to_string. Suppress at the generated-crate header instead of
  requiring per-task clippy flags downstream.
- **alef-backend-rustler**: emit `base_url:` inline in the generated
  `native.ex` instead of wrapped across two lines. Under the kreuzberg-dev
  `line_length: 120` convention, `mix format --check-formatted` collapses
  the wrap, so each `alef e2e generate` drifted against pre-commit.
- **alef-docs**: inject a trailing blank line after every heading at render
  time. The shared `heading.jinja` / `version_heading.jinja` templates can't
  carry a trailing blank line — the pre-commit `end-of-file-fixer` hook
  strips it on every commit — so wrap `template_env::render` to add the
  blank line for those two templates. Resolves the rumdl MD022 cycle that
  added ~1100 fixes across 18 `docs/reference/api-*.md` files per regen.

## [0.15.57] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **alef-backend-wasm**: `gen_opaque_method` now respects `mutex_types` for both `&self` and `&mut self` methods on opaque types whose `inner` field is `Arc<Mutex<T>>`. Previously: (a) `&self` methods on Mutex-wrapped opaque types emitted `self.inner.{method}(...)` which fails to compile against `Arc<Mutex<T>>`, and (b) `&mut self` methods on opaque types fell through `shared::can_auto_delegate`'s blanket `RefMut → false` exclusion and were emitted as no-op `gen_wasm_unimplemented_body` stubs. Concretely surfaced in tree-sitter-language-pack's `WasmTreeCursor::node()`, `field_name()`, `goto_first_child()`, `goto_parent()`, `goto_next_sibling()`. Fix: override `can_delegate` for RefMut methods when `mutex_types.contains(type_name)` (mirrors the existing override in `methods.rs:33`), and dispatch via `self.inner.lock().unwrap().{method}(...)` for both `&self` and Owned receivers on Mutex-wrapped types.

## [0.15.56] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **alef-backend-wasm**: wrap opaque-type constructor returns and `&self`-method returns in `Arc::new(std::sync::Mutex::new(...))` when the target type has `&mut self` methods (i.e. is in the new `mutex_types` set). Previously `gen_function` / `gen_method` / `gen_opaque_struct_methods` emitted bare `Arc::new(...)` regardless of whether the opaque struct field was `Arc<T>` or `Arc<Mutex<T>>`, producing invalid Rust like `inner: Arc::new(Parser::default())` against an `Arc<Mutex<Parser>>` field. Threads a `mutex_types: &AHashSet<String>` set through `gen_bindings/{functions,methods,types,mod}.rs` and uses `generators::wrap_return_with_mutex` at every Arc-wrapping site (parallels the Magnus fix in v0.15.55). Constructors no longer emit a double-nested struct-init (the wrap helper already returns the complete `Self { inner: ... }` expression).
- **alef-e2e/kotlin**: additional sticky-nullability + enum-typed field detection refinements in `crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/kotlin.rs` plus shared `crates/alef-e2e/src/field_access.rs`; corresponding go/swift/streaming generator updates and `crates/alef-scaffold/src/languages/kotlin.rs` adjustments.
- **all visitor backends**: update all codegen sites that construct a `VisitorHandle` to use `Arc::new(Mutex::new(...))` instead of `Rc::new(RefCell::new(...))`, matching the updated `VisitorHandle` type alias (`Arc<Mutex<dyn HtmlVisitor + Send>>`). Affected backends: PHP, PyO3, NAPI (4 Jinja templates + 2 Rust sites), WASM (Jinja template + 3 Rust sites + `unsafe impl Send + Sync` in visitor bridge), Magnus (Rust + Jinja visitor bridge + `unsafe impl Send + Sync`), Rustler (template env + trait bridge), extendr (trait bridge + gen_bindings use stmts), FFI (gen_bridge_field + gen_visitor VisitorRef + `unsafe impl Send + Sync` on `{Prefix}Visitor` and `VisitorRef`). Also updates the Rust e2e test generator (`alef-e2e`) to emit `Arc::new(Mutex::new(...))` for the test visitor.
- **alef-backend-java**: switch generated instance-method `Arena` from `Arena.ofConfined()` to `Arena.ofShared()` so cross-thread access to `MemorySegment`s doesn't panic in pooled / async caller contexts.
- **alef-e2e/kotlin**: mock URL now resolves via the per-fixture system property set by `MockServerListener`, falling back to `mockServerUrl` / `MOCK_SERVER_URL` env var with the `/fixtures/<id>` suffix appended.

## [0.15.55] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **alef-backend-gleam**: restore the Gleam backend, e2e codegen, scaffold, publish package, and `Language::Gleam` enum variant that were removed in v0.15.54 by mistake. Gleam is a first-class alef-supported binding language again, with the full backend crate (`alef-backend-gleam`), e2e codegen (`crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/gleam.rs`), publish package handler, scaffold, readme template, doc emission, and downstream registry/match-arm wiring across `alef-core`, `alef-codegen`, `alef-adapters`, `alef-docs`, `alef-cli`, `alef-publish`, `alef-readme`, and `alef-scaffold`. Note: kreuzberg has independently dropped its own Gleam binding (BEAM users can call the Elixir binding via Erlang interop); restoring Gleam here keeps the language available for downstream alef users who want it.

### Fixed

- **alef-e2e/kotlin**: sticky nullability in `render_kotlin_with_optionals`. Once a `?.` safe-call is emitted for any segment in a Kotlin accessor chain, all subsequent segments are on a nullable receiver and must also use `?.`. The previous code reset `prev_was_nullable` to just `is_optional` on each segment, so non-optional fields after a `?.` call dropped the safe-call, producing uncompilable code (e.g. `toolCalls()?.first().function()` instead of `toolCalls()?.first()?.function()`). Fixed in all three `PathSegment` arms (`Field`, `ArrayField`, `MapAccess`).

- **alef-e2e/kotlin**: auto-detect enum-typed fields from IR `TypeDef` to route through `.getValue()`. Fields whose Rust type is `Named(T)` where `T` is not a known struct (i.e. an enum) must call `.getValue()` in Kotlin assertions. Previously only fields in the global `fields_enum` or a per-call `enum_fields` override were handled; `BatchObject.status` (type `BatchStatus`) was silently treated as `String`, causing `"BatchStatus has no method trim"` at Kotlin compile time. Now `generate()` builds a `type_enum_fields` map from the IR and merges it into `effective_enum_fields` per call. Also extends `field_is_optional` to detect nullability from the accessor expression itself (sticky-`?.` chain makes the whole expression `T?` regardless of what the path-prefix lookup finds).

- **alef-backend-magnus**: WIP: correctly convert `&DTO` and `&[&str]` parameter shapes when calling core functions. Functions and methods accepting references to generated DTO structs and string slices now emit proper type conversions at the FFI boundary. Serde recovery path creates `{name}_core` bindings for Named params; Vec<String> ref params create `{name}_core` intermediate Vec<&str> bindings consumed by `gen_call_args_with_let_bindings`.

- **alef-backend-csharp**: serialize enum values as strings via JsonStringEnumConverter (matches python/node/go/java/ruby/php). All C# enums now emit `[JsonConverter(typeof(JsonStringEnumConverter))]` to serialize as JSON strings (e.g. `"function"`) instead of numeric discriminants (e.g. `0`), matching other language bindings.

## [0.15.54] - 2026-05-13

### Added

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-rustler): wrap bare opaque returns and Optional<opaque> returns in ResourceArc<T> in NIF function/method signatures. Functions returning T (opaque type) now emit `ResourceArc<T>` instead of bare `T`, and functions returning `Option<T>` emit `Option<ResourceArc<T>>` instead of `Option<T>`. Methods on opaque types now call inner methods via `resource.inner.as_ref().method()` to properly dereference the Arc and invoke the inner type's methods (required for methods like `clone()`). Fixes compile errors where `Tree`, `Node`, `TreeCursor`, `Parser` were used directly without ResourceArc wrapping, which violated Rustler's Encoder trait bounds.

- fix(alef-e2e/typescript): gate streaming-virtual interception on is_streaming, matching go fix. TypeScript codegen now respects the `streaming = false` opt-out at the call level, skipping the virtual field interception (chunks, stream_content, etc.) and allowing them to be resolved normally through the result struct accessor path. Non-streaming fixtures no longer emit references to undeclared `chunks` variable.

- fix(alef-backend-magnus): delegate all methods through `Mutex` on types with `&mut self` methods. When an opaque type has any `&mut self` methods, ALL its methods (including `&self` methods) must use `.lock().unwrap()` to access the inner value in `Arc<Mutex<T>>`. Previously, only `&mut self` methods got the lock, leaving `&self` methods calling `.method()` directly on `Arc<Mutex<T>>`, which fails because `Arc` has no such methods. Now matches the NAPI and PyO3 patterns: if `has_mut_methods`, emit `.lock().unwrap()` for all delegation.
- fix(alef-backend-pyo3): surface trait-bridge `OptionsField` kwargs in the generated `.pyi` for both struct `__init__` and module-level functions. The cfg-gated bridge field (e.g. `ConversionOptions.visitor`) is stripped by the `gen_stubs.rs` partition (`f.cfg.is_none()`), but the PyO3 `#[new]` macro keeps it via `never_skip_cfg_field_names`, so api.py callers like `_rust.ConversionOptions(visitor=...)` and `_rust.convert(html, options, visitor=...)` failed `mypy --strict` with `Unexpected keyword argument "visitor"`. Stubs now append the bridge kwarg as `{kwarg_name}: {type_alias} | None = None` whenever the options type is referenced, mirroring the wrapper signature in `gen_bindings/functions.rs`.
- fix(alef-backend-wasm): wrap opaque types with `&mut self` methods in `Arc<Mutex<T>>` matching NAPI/PyO3/Magnus pattern. Opaque types now detect `RefMut` receivers and conditionally wrap the inner type in `std::sync::Mutex` so that method delegation can call `.lock().unwrap()` before invoking mutable methods. Previously generated `Arc<T>` unconditionally, causing invalid code when methods tried to call `.lock()` on non-Mutex types.
- fix(alef-backend-wasm): gate the `self.inner.lock().unwrap()` call path on the receiver type actually being opaque. Methods on transparent (named-field) structs whose type happens to have a sibling `&mut self` method (e.g. `WasmDocumentStructure::is_empty` alongside `finalize_node_types`) were emitting `self.inner.lock().unwrap().is_empty()` even though the struct has direct fields and no `inner: Arc<Mutex<T>>`. Codegen now checks `opaque_types.contains(type_name)` before taking the Mutex branch; transparent structs fall back to `Type::from(self.clone()).method(...)`.
- fix(alef-backend-csharp): pass length argument alongside pinned pointer when delegating byte-slice params to native P/Invoke. Wrapper methods now emit both the `AddrOfPinnedObject()` pointer AND the `(UIntPtr)source.Length` argument for `&[u8]` parameters, matching the FFI signature. Previously only the pointer was passed, causing C# compile errors (CS7036: missing required parameter) when parsing byte arrays.
- fix(alef-e2e/kotlin): fix `{kotlin_val}` placeholder in numeric comparison assertion failure messages. The `greater_than`, `less_than`, `greater_than_or_equal`, and `less_than_or_equal` assertions emitted literal text `expected > {kotlin_val}` because the placeholder was doubly-escaped (`{{kotlin_val}}`), causing Kotlin source parse errors (`Expecting an element`).
- fix(alef-e2e): backtick-escape Kotlin hard keywords when emitting field accessors. Field paths like `result.data().first().object()` are syntax errors in Kotlin because `object` is a hard keyword; now emitted as `` result.data().first().`object`() ``. Applies to both plain and nullable-aware Kotlin accessor renderers.

## [0.15.53] - 2026-05-13

### Added

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-magnus): pass missing `mutex_types` argument in Magnus `gen_function` unit-test call sites after the signature change, fixing `cargo check` failures in `gen_bindings_test`.

### Added

- feat(alef-e2e): add `[e2e.calls.<name>] streaming = false | true` opt-in/out at the call config level. When set to `false`, the streaming-virtual-field auto-detection is disabled — assertions that reference field names like `chunks` / `chunks.length` / `tool_calls` / `finish_reason` on a synchronous result type are treated as plain field accessors rather than streaming adapters. Without this, an API whose return value happens to have a `chunks: Vec<T>` field that is not actually streamed (e.g. a code-chunking result) would be incorrectly emitted with `async for chunk in result` and `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators across every backend that supports streaming. `None` (default) preserves the prior auto-detect heuristic so existing LLM-style downstream crates are unchanged. Honored by all backends that previously hard-coded the heuristic: python, typescript (node + wasm), go, java, php, elixir, kotlin, swift, dart. A new `resolve_is_streaming(fixture, call_config.streaming)` helper in `codegen/streaming_assertions.rs` is the single source of truth so future backends pick up the opt-out automatically.

### Fixed

- fix(alef-e2e/go): gate the streaming-virtual-field assertion interception in `render_assertion` on the resolved `is_streaming` flag (threaded through from `render_test_function`). Without this gate, a call with `streaming = false` whose result type happens to have a `chunks` field would still emit `len(chunks)` referencing an undeclared local (streaming chunks-var) instead of the plain `len(result.Chunks)` field accessor. Matches the python/typescript backends which already short-circuit when streaming is disabled.

- fix(alef-backend-magnus): wrap opaque types with `&mut self` methods in `Arc<Mutex<T>>` instead of bare `Arc<T>`, and allow delegation of `&mut self` methods via `.lock().unwrap()`. Previously, opaque structs were always wrapped in `Arc` with no mutex, and methods with `&mut self` receivers were stubbed as "Not implemented". This fix enables real implementations for methods like `Parser::set_language`. Complements equivalent fixes already in NAPI and PHP backends.

- fix(alef-backend-php): allow delegation of `&mut self` methods on opaque types wrapped in `Arc<Mutex<T>>`. Previously the can_delegate check rejected all RefMut receivers (line 396) assuming Arc doesn't support `&mut T`. However, when a type has any RefMut methods (indicating Mutex-wrapping), those methods CAN be delegated by locking the mutex. This fix enables real implementations for methods like `Parser::set_language` instead of stubbed "Not implemented" bodies.

- fix(alef-backend-napi): allow delegation of `&mut self` methods on opaque types wrapped in `Arc<Mutex<T>>`. Previously the opaque_can_delegate check rejected all RefMut receivers (line 418) assuming Arc doesn't support `&mut T`. However, when a type has any RefMut methods (indicating Mutex-wrapping), those methods CAN be delegated by locking the mutex. This fix enables real implementations for methods like `Parser::set_language` instead of stubbed "Not implemented" bodies.

- fix(alef-e2e/csharp): emit `<GenerateAssemblyInfo>false</GenerateAssemblyInfo>` in the e2e test project `.csproj` to prevent duplicate `AssemblyInfo` attributes when a hand-written `Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs` file provides assembly metadata manually. The .NET SDK auto-generates `obj/*/AssemblyInfo.cs` by default, leading to CS0579 errors when both files define the same attributes. Complements the assembly info file previously generated for e2e projects.

- fix(alef-e2e/python): also include per-fixture streaming in the file-level `is_async` calculation used to gate `import pytest`. Previously a file containing fixtures whose `is_streaming` was triggered only by virtual-field assertions (not by call-level `async`) would emit `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators without the matching `import pytest`, producing `NameError`/F821 on test collection. Now `needs_pytest` correctly reflects every code path that emits an async test.

- fix(alef-backend-extendr): generate `String` (not `Robj`) for non-options string parameters in `gen_extendr_bridge_field_function`, and build the core-function call from the actual params instead of a hardcoded `convert(&html, …)` literal. The previous output emitted `pub fn convert(html: Robj, options: Robj)` and then called `core::convert(&html, Some(opts))` — `&Robj` doesn't satisfy `&str`, so the generated R binding crate failed to compile. Now string params decode via extendr's `TryFrom<Robj> for String` and the `&name` call site deref-coerces to `&str`.

- fix(alef-e2e/r): wrap array-valued fields in `I(...)` when emitting `jsonlite::toJSON(list(...), auto_unbox = TRUE)` for the `Type$from_json(...)` typed-config code path. Without the `AsIs` marker, single-element vectors were unboxed to scalars (`c("foo")` → `"foo"`) and empty vectors collapsed to `{}`, causing serde to reject `Vec<T>` fields with `invalid type: string "foo", expected a sequence`. Non-empty arrays now emit as `I(c(...))` (→ `[...]`) and empty arrays as `I(list())` (→ `[]`), fixing 9 R e2e failures across `exclude_selectors`, `strip_tags`, `preserve_tags`, and `keep_inline_images_in`.

- fix(alef-e2e/r): visitor-test arg builder now strips any pre-existing `options = …` argument before appending `options = list(visitor = visitor)`, instead of only stripping the literal `options = NULL`. The previous code left `options = ConversionOptions$default()` in place when `build_args_string` emitted a default placeholder, producing duplicated named args that R rejects with `formal argument "options" matched by multiple actual arguments`. New `strip_options_arg` helper walks the args string while tracking paren/quote depth so nested commas inside `options = list(visitor = visitor)` aren't treated as arg separators.

- fix(alef-backend-csharp): emit single `{` / `}` (not `{{` / `}}`) in the `VisitResult.ToFfiJson()` string-concatenation literals for `Custom` and `Error` variants. The template was authored as if the surrounding code were a C# interpolated string (`$"…"`), where `{{` escapes to `{` — but the emitted source is a plain string-concatenation, so `{{` came out as literal double-braces, producing `{{"Custom":"…"}}` which Rust's serde rejects. C# visitor overrides (`VisitResult.Custom("…")`) now round-trip correctly across the FFI boundary, fixing all C# e2e visitor tests (42 fixtures previously regressing).

- fix(alef-backend-csharp): include `api.enums` (alongside `api.types`) when building the `visible_type_names` set passed to trait-bridge codegen. Without this, enum types like `VisitResult` were treated as non-API by `csharp_type_visible`, which substituted them with `string` in generated trait-method signatures (`string VisitFigureEnd(...)`). E2e visitor tests that returned `VisitResult.Continue` then failed to compile with CS0738 "does not have the matching return type of 'string'".

- fix(alef-e2e/csharp): look up `enum_fields` and `nested_types` overrides by both snake_case (fixture JSON key) and camelCase (alef.toml convention) when emitting C# object initializers. Previously fixtures with `code_block_style: "Backticks"` produced `CodeBlockStyle = "Backticks"` (raw string literal) instead of `CodeBlockStyle = CodeBlockStyle.Backticks` (enum constant), causing ~18 CS0029 compile errors. C# is strongly typed and does not accept string-to-enum implicit conversion, unlike Python's ConversionOptions which accepts strings and converts internally.


## [0.15.52] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- feat(scaffold/node): add `futures-util` to generated Node binding `Cargo.toml` so `chat_stream` compiles without requiring a manual dependency addition

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-magnus): enums now use the variant marked with `#[default]` instead of always the first variant in source order. This respects Rust's `#[derive(Default)]` semantics. Fixes `CodeBlockStyle` defaulting to `Backticks` (marked `#[default]`) instead of `Indented`, enabling fenced code blocks with language annotations.
- fix(alef-backend-magnus): emit explicit `impl Default` for all binding structs with fields instead of deriving `Default`, which gives all-zeros initialization. Explicit impls use field-level defaults computed by config_gen (same as kwargs constructors), ensuring serde deserialization with missing fields produces correct values (e.g., `PreprocessingOptions.enabled=true` instead of false). Properly handles `Option<T>` fields which always default to `None`.

- fix(napi,pyo3,wasm,php): allow `clippy::should_implement_trait` at the crate level so opaque-type wrappers carrying a `pub fn clone(&self) -> Self` method (lifted from the upstream `Clone` derive on the wrapped Rust type) compile under `-D warnings`. Without the allow, NAPI/PyO3/wasm-bindgen/ext-php-rs surfaces fail clippy because the inherent method shadows `std::clone::Clone::clone`; the bindings still derive `Clone` for the wrapper type so trait dispatch is unaffected.

- fix(alef-backend-magnus): unit-enum `TryConvert` now also accepts the PascalCase Rust variant name (e.g. `"Tildes"`, `"AtxClosed"`) alongside the serde wire form (e.g. `"tildes"`). Fixtures and tests written in either style now deserialize correctly.
- fix(alef-e2e/ruby): emit string-equals assertions as `expr.to_s.strip == expected.strip` to match Python's pattern, masking trailing-newline differences fixture authors don't write into expected values. Drops ~10 ruby e2e failures in html-to-markdown.
- fix(alef-e2e/field_access): render Ruby hash map-access as `["key"]` instead of `.get("key")`. Ruby's `Hash` has no `get` method, so previously-generated assertions like `result.metadata.document.open_graph.get("title")` raised `NoMethodError`.
- fix(alef-e2e/typescript): look up `enum_fields` overrides by both snake_case (fixture key) and camelCase (alef.toml convention) when emitting WASM-class field assignments. Previously fixtures with `code_block_style: "Tildes"` produced `_u.codeBlockStyle = "Tildes"` (raw string) instead of `_u.codeBlockStyle = WasmCodeBlockStyle.Tildes` (enum constant), and wasm-bindgen silently dropped the assignment so options like code-block style, heading style, and highlight style never took effect.
- fix(alef-backend-magnus): in `gen_options_field_bridge_function`, recognise Ruby `ConversionOptions` class instances passed as the options argument and convert them to core via `.clone().into()`. Previously only `Hash` and visitor objects were accepted, so tests doing `HtmlToMarkdownRs::ConversionOptions.new(...)` were misclassified as visitors and the options were dropped (e.g. `include_document_structure` never flowed through, leaving `result.document` nil). Also drives the options type name from the IR so the helper isn't hard-wired to `ConversionOptions`.
- fix(alef-backend-napi): stop clearing `o.visitor = None` before `o.into()` in `gen_options_field_bridge_function`. The From impl now forwards `val.visitor` through `JsHtmlVisitorBridge` (via the existing post-process), so the handle survives the conversion. A separate kwarg-supplied visitor still overrides when present. Without this fix, JS callers passing `convert(html, { visitor: ... })` silently lost the visitor and callbacks never fired.
- fix(alef-e2e/typescript): emit Node visitor tests as `convert(html, options, visitor)` (three positional args) instead of merging `visitor` into the options object literal. napi-rs cannot deserialize `Option<Object<'static>>` from a JS object property, so the visitor field was always `None` on the Rust side; routing through the existing kwarg path wraps the JS object via `JsHtmlVisitorBridge::new`.
- fix(alef-e2e/typescript): wrap WASM e2e visitor tests' visitor argument with `new WasmVisitorHandle(...)`. wasm-bindgen's generated setter for `WasmConversionOptions.visitor` enforces `_assertClass(value, WasmVisitorHandle)` and rejects plain JS objects. Auto-import `WasmVisitorHandle` alongside `WasmConversionOptions`. Also preserve the trailing `html` positional argument when the fixture has no other options (previous IIFE rewrite replaced it).
- fix(e2e/kotlin): derive JAR name by replacing hyphens with underscores (`rootProject.name` uses underscores, producing e.g. `liter_llm-VERSION.jar`); bare hyphenated name caused "Unresolved reference" linking errors
- fix(e2e/kotlin): wrap generated `@Test` bodies in `runBlocking { }` when the binding exposes `suspend fun` methods; previously tests called coroutine methods outside a coroutine scope and crashed with `IllegalStateException`
- fix(e2e/kotlin): append `L` suffix to integer literals for `uint64_t`/`int64_t` fields (e.g. `assertEquals(6L, result.promptTokens())`) to prevent Kotlin long-vs-int type mismatch compilation errors

- feat(backend-php): emit per-opaque-type PHP stub class files under the configured `output` directory. Each opaque type with public methods gets its own `<TypeName>.php` declaring `public function` signatures, so static analysers and IDEs see the type's surface. Mirrors the existing `.rbs` stub pattern in `alef-backend-magnus`.
- feat(backend-rustler): emit idiomatic Elixir `.ex` wrapper modules for opaque types with methods. Each opaque type gets `defstruct [:ref]` plus per-method delegations to `TreeSitterLanguagePack.Native.<type>_<method>(obj.ref, ...)`, so Elixir callers get a typed module-based API instead of raw NIF call sites.

### Fixed

- fix(backend-napi): correctly resolve type names for opaque-vs-capsule types when used as parameters and return types. Capsule types (e.g. `Language` configured under `[crates.node.capsule_types]`) now reference the ecosystem-library type directly with no `Js` prefix; non-capsule opaque types (e.g. user-defined `Parser`/`Tree`/`Node`) get the `Js` prefix. Fixes "cannot find type `JsLanguage`" / "cannot find struct `Node`" errors when a project defines its own wrapper types alongside capsule passthrough.
- fix(backend-napi): for opaque types with any `&mut self` method, wrap the inner value in `Arc<Mutex<T>>` consistently — at struct construction (`Arc::new(Mutex::new(raw))` instead of `Arc::new(raw)`) and in every method body (acquire `.lock()` before the inner call). Resolves "no method named X found for `Arc<Mutex<T>>`" errors and Arc-double-wrap mismatches.
- fix(backend-pyo3): mirror the napi Mutex wrapping fix for opaque types with `&mut self` methods (same root cause, same fix shape).
- fix(backend-php): same Mutex wrapping fix as napi/pyo3 — propagate the computed `mutex_types` set through the codegen pipeline (`gen_opaque_struct_methods` → `gen_instance_method` → `php_wrap_return`) and emit `.lock().unwrap()` for method dispatch on `Arc<Mutex<T>>` opaque fields.
- fix(alef-codegen,core-to-binding): stop wiping cfg-gated trait-bridge fields to `Default::default()` in the core→binding conversion. The previous block in `gen_from_core_to_binding_cfg` forced `visitor: Default::default()` whenever the field's type referenced an opaque wrapper, dropping PHP/Node/WASM visitor objects between the binding builder and the core call. The field now flows through the normal `val.field.into()` conversion (or the `Option<Option<T>>` recursive path), so bindings that wrap visitors as their own opaque types forward them correctly.
- fix(alef-codegen,binding-to-core): forward trait-bridge Arc-wrapper fields instead of emitting `Default::default()` in the binding→core direction. The `is_opaque_no_wrapper_field` branch in `binding_to_core.rs` previously dropped fields like PHP's `Option<VisitorHandle>` (where `VisitorHandle { inner: Arc<core::VisitorHandle> }`). Added a `ConversionConfig::trait_bridge_arc_wrapper_field_names` slice populated from each backend's OptionsField bridges; when a field is in that list the conversion emits `val.{field}.map(|v| (*v.inner).clone())` (or the non-optional equivalent). Fixes 48 PHP visitor e2e failures where the builder set a visitor that was then silently dropped by `.into()`.
- fix(alef-backend-napi): soften the `find_options_field_binding` filter to accept cfg-gated trait-bridge fields whose names appear in `never_skip_cfg_field_names` (e.g. `visitor`). The previous `f.cfg.is_none()` predicate rejected the visitor field outright, causing the NAPI `convert` codegen to fall through to the plain `gen_function` path with no visitor parameter and a `From<JsConversionOptions>` impl that hardcoded `__result.visitor = Default::default()`. With the softened filter the options-field-bridge codepath activates: `convert` exposes `visitor: Option<Object>` and the JS visitor is woven into the core `ConversionOptions` before `core::convert()` is called.
- fix(alef-backend-wasm): make the Phase C `From<Wasm{options_type}>` visitor-forwarding post-process tolerant of indentation variations. The previous exact whitespace match (12-space indent only) silently failed to substitute `visitor: Default::default()` when the surrounding output used different indentation. The substitution now tries 12-, 8-, and 2-space indents so the forwarding (`val.visitor.map(|v| (*v.inner).clone())`) actually lands on every generated `From<Wasm…>` impl. Fixes 62 WASM visitor e2e failures.
- fix(alef-backend-java): align `gen_visitor_bridge` callback-chunking constants. Previously the constructor computed `num_chunks = CALLBACKS.chunks(10).count()` while the per-chunk method emitter used a local `const CHUNK_SIZE: usize = 5`. With 40 callbacks the emitter produced 8 `registerStubsN` methods but the constructor invoked only 4 of them, leaving callbacks 20–39 (`visit_button`, `visit_iframe`, `visit_mark`, `visit_video`, `visit_input`, etc.) NULL in the C struct. Lifted `CHUNK_SIZE = 5` to module scope and used it in both places. Fixes 28 Java visitor e2e failures.
- fix(alef-backend-magnus): emit `require "json"` once in the generated Ruby ext module init, and replace `.unwrap_or_default()` on the options-deserialization funcall with explicit `magnus::Error` propagation. Ruby's `Hash#to_json` only exists after `require "json"`; the gem didn't load the stdlib, so `funcall("to_json", ())` raised `NoMethodError`, the previous `unwrap_or_default()` swallowed it, and the entire options object reverted to `ConversionOptions::default()` (`include_document_structure: false`, no preprocessing, etc.) across 30+ Ruby e2e specs. The module-init `require "json"` makes `Hash#to_json` available, and the error-propagating `.map_err` surfaces any future failures instead of silently defaulting.

#### kreuzcrawl iteration (16-language e2e convergence)

- fix(alef-e2e/c): emit `char*` JSON-roundtrip path (instead of opaque-handle pattern) for FFI functions whose result type is `char*` such as `batch_scrape`. Driven by a new `raw_c_result_type` override threaded through `render_engine_factory_test_function`; the emitter writes `char* result = kcrawl_{fn}(...); kcrawl_free_string(result);` instead of the wrapper-constructor + `*_free` pattern. Previously generated `KCRAWLBatchScrape* result = kcrawl_batch_scrape(...)` referencing an undeclared type.
- fix(alef-e2e/c): parse `MOCK_SERVERS={"<id>":"<url>",...}` from the spawned mock-server's stdout in the generated `Makefile` test target and export `MOCK_SERVER_<UPPER_ID>` env vars for the test binary; the per-call URL setup now prefers `getenv("MOCK_SERVER_<UPPER_FIXTURE_ID>")` over the shared `MOCK_SERVER_URL/fixtures/<id>` fallback. Required for host-root fixtures (robots/sitemap) where a single port can only serve one robots.txt.
- fix(alef-e2e/c): for `expects_error` fixtures, emit a soft early-return when `kcrawl_crawl_config_from_json` or `kcrawl_create_engine` returns NULL rather than `assert(... != NULL)`. Tests asserting that config validation fails no longer abort the suite.
- fix(alef-e2e/dart): resolve `xxx[].yyy` traversal aliases on the full path before splitting around `[]`, so renamed sub-fields like `assets[].category` → `assets[].asset_category` route correctly through `field_resolver`. Previously the head was alias-resolved but the element segment kept the fixture-side name and missed the renamed accessor.
- fix(alef-e2e/dart): construct `FieldResolver` per file; emit `createCrawlConfigFromJson` setup and `createEngine(config: ...)` named-arg syntax to match the flutter_rust_bridge facade; route field accessors through `field_resolver.accessor("dart", ...)` for alias + nullability; `is_empty` matcher emits `anyOf(isNull, isEmpty)` to accommodate FRB nullable strings/lists.
- fix(alef-e2e/field_access): in the dart renderer, `PathSegment::Length` honours `prev_was_nullable` (emits `?.length`) and `PathSegment::ArrayField` only adds `!` when the field is itself optional. Prevents `Null check operator used on a null value` runtime failures on optional list/string fields.
- fix(alef-e2e/kotlin): set `PropertyNamingStrategies.SNAKE_CASE` on the generated test-suite `ObjectMapper` so Jackson deserializes the snake_case JSON wire format from the Rust FFI into the Kotlin record's camelCase fields (matches the Java mapper convention).
- fix(alef-e2e/kotlin): for fixtures with `has_host_root_route()`, emit `System.getProperty("mockServer.<fixture_id>", ...)` as the URL source so host-root fixtures route to their per-fixture listener (matches the Java emitter pattern).
- fix(alef-e2e/swift): for `expects_error` fixtures, hoist setup lines (config-from-JSON, create-engine) INSIDE the `do { } catch { }` block so config-validation errors are caught by the test. Previously the setup `try` was outside the do, so validation failures aborted the test instead of being asserted.
- fix(alef-e2e/swift): hoist `RustVec<T>` subscript temporaries into local variables (new `materialise_vec_temporaries` helper). swift-bridge's `RustVec<T>` subscript returns a `T.SelfRef` holding a raw pointer into the Vec's storage; without a local binding the Vec gets ARC-released before the ref is used, leaving a dangling pointer (observed as empty JSON-LD test data, then SIGSEGV under stress).
- fix(alef-e2e/php): templates/synthetic_assertion.jinja gains a trailing newline. Previously the skip-comment for unavailable fields ran into the following assertion on the same line, making the assertion part of the comment (PHPUnit reported affected tests as "risky" with no assertions, exiting non-zero).
- fix(alef-backend-csharp): filter `compute_handle_returned_types` to types with `has_serde == false`, so only truly-opaque handle types route through the constructor-wrapper pattern (`new T(IntPtr)`). Value records like `ScrapeResult`, `CrawlResult`, `MapResult`, `ContentConfig`, `BrowserConfig`, `CrawlConfig` stay on the JSON-roundtrip path (`*ToJson` → `JsonSerializer.Deserialize` → `*Free`). The earlier opaque-handle change had widened the wrapper-path to all named returns, breaking compilation of every serde-backed value-type return with `CS1729: 'T' does not contain a constructor that takes 1 arguments`.
- fix(alef-e2e/wasm): auto-import nested config types referenced as `handle_config_type` values (e.g. `WasmBrowserConfig`, `WasmAuthConfig`) even when they aren't direct `json_object` args. The codegen now includes `handle_config_type` in `all_options_types` for WASM and derives transitive nested types in `build_args_and_setup` so they're wrapped with proper class constructors at the test call site.
- fix(alef-e2e/wasm): in `templates/wasm/globalSetup.ts.jinja`, parse `MOCK_SERVERS={...}` from the spawned mock-server's stdout and export per-fixture `MOCK_SERVER_<UPPER_FIXTURE_ID>` env vars so host-root fixtures (robots/sitemap) reach their dedicated listener instead of the shared base port.
- fix(alef-e2e/brew): emit `${MOCK_SERVER_<UPPER_FIXTURE_ID>:-${MOCK_SERVER_URL}/fixtures/<id>}` for `mock_url` args so host-root fixtures route correctly when the mock-server allocates a per-fixture listener; the generated `*.sh` tests fall back to the shared `MOCK_SERVER_URL/fixtures/<id>` form for fixtures without isolation.
- fix(alef-e2e/brew): when fixture `input.config` is non-empty, append `--config '<minified json>'` to the generated CLI command so the kreuzcrawl CLI honors fixture-specified config (e.g. `respect_robots_txt: true`, validation fixtures). Pairs with the kreuzcrawl-side `--config` flag added to `scrape`/`crawl`/`map`.


## [0.15.51] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- fix(backend-java): emit `@JsonProperty("snake_case_name")` on request type fields where the Java camelCase name differs from the original snake_case IR name; adds `import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty` automatically when needed
- fix(e2e-elixir): streaming assertions now use `Enum.at(choices, 0)` instead of invalid `choices[0]` bracket access on Elixir lists
- fix(e2e-elixir): smoke test fallback api_key uses `"test-key"` instead of `nil` when no env var is set, preventing NIF rejection of nil for required String parameter
- fix(wasm): optional-enum getters return `Option<String>` via `to_api_str()` instead of raw C-style enum discriminant; optional `Vec<Struct>` getters return `Option<js_sys::Array>` for correct JS element access
- fix(e2e): mock server serves `data: [DONE]\n\n` SSE response for streaming fixtures with empty `stream_chunks` array, preventing Python SSE parser from hanging

## [0.15.50] - 2026-05-12

### Removed

- chore: drop Gleam language backend, codegen, scaffold, publish support, and `Language::Gleam` enum variant

## [0.15.49] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- feat(core,backends): `TraitBridgeConfig` gains `context_type` and `result_type` fields, plus a `ResolvedCrateConfig::bridge_associated_types()` helper that aggregates them across all configured bridges. Backends use this to skip generic record/POJO codegen for the bridge's associated types instead of hardcoding literal `"NodeContext"` / `"VisitResult"` checks against h2m's HtmlVisitor types. Any project with a callback-style trait can now wire its own context/result types through the bridge codegen.

### Fixed

- fix(codegen): scope cfg-gated trait-bridge field detection to fields whose type references an opaque wrapper (per `cfg.opaque_type_names`). The previous logic in `gen_from_core_to_binding_cfg` + the struct emitters forced `Default::default()` / `#[serde(skip)]` for any cfg-gated field listed in `never_skip_cfg_field_names`, which incorrectly defaulted regular convertible fields like `metadata: HtmlMetadata` on `ConversionResult`. Restores `result.metadata.document.*` access in the Python binding (h2m).
- fix(backend-pyo3,backend-wasm): drive trait-bridge post-process from `core_import` instead of hardcoded crate names. The pyo3 visitor-fallback rewrite and the wasm `From<Wasm*>` impl rewrite previously matched the literal string `html_to_markdown_rs`, breaking codegen for any other project using `bind_via = "options_field"`. Both now build their search/replace patterns via the configured `core_import` plus the per-bridge `type_alias` / `options_type` / `resolved_options_field`. The wasm rewrite also no longer relies on a hardcoded anchor field (`strong_em_symbol`) to scope the From-impl search — it now finds the impl block by its full `impl From<Wasm{options_type}> for ...` header.
- fix(wasm-backend): WASM trait bridge constructor now correctly reads the JS object's `name` property as a plain string. The previous implementation called `dyn_into::<js_sys::Function>()` on the value returned by `Reflect::get(&js_obj, "name")`, which always failed because `name` is a string property, not a method — causing the chain to fall through to `unwrap_or_else(|| "wasm_bridge".to_string())` unconditionally. Fixed by removing the intermediate `dyn_into::<Function>` step and calling `.as_string()` directly on the `JsValue` returned by `Reflect::get`.
- fix(wasm-backend): `build_wasm_arg` no longer uses Rust `{:?}` Debug formatting for non-primitive JS bridge arguments. The previous fallback emitted binary debug repr for `&[u8]` parameters (e.g. `[72, 101, 108, 108, 111]` instead of a `Uint8Array`) and Rust field syntax for complex types, both of which are unrecognisable at the JS call site. Fixed: `TypeRef::Bytes` now emits `js_sys::Uint8Array::from(...)` for correct typed-array interop; all remaining complex types (`Named`, `Vec`, `Map`, etc.) now use `serde_wasm_bindgen::to_value(...)` so they arrive as plain JS objects.
- fix(wasm-backend): async WASM trait bridge methods now correctly await the `Promise` returned by the JS function. `func.apply()` on a JavaScript `async` function returns a `Promise` object, not the resolved value; the previous implementation treated it as the final result and called `.as_string()` on the `Promise` itself, so all async bridge methods silently returned the default value. Fixed by casting via `dyn_into::<js_sys::Promise>()` and awaiting with `wasm_bindgen_futures::JsFuture::from(promise).await`.
- fix(alef-e2e/swift): `[].` traversal element accessor now resolves field aliases before computing the Swift method name (e.g. `assets[].category` → `assetCategory()` not `category()`); enum elements now call `.toString()` not `.to_string().toString()`.
- fix(alef-backend-dart): add `rust_input: crate` to the generated `flutter_rust_bridge.yaml` — omitting it caused `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate` to panic.
- fix(alef-backend-go): filter `ffi_skip_methods` in trait bridge generation so FFI-incompatible methods are not emitted in the Go C-VTable.
- fix(alef-backend-java): add a post-generation line-length wrapping pass to keep Checkstyle happy on compound annotation and call-argument lines.
- fix(alef-backend-napi): skip opaque-struct methods whose return type is a capsule type; the capsule shim uses `napi_create_external` directly, so no wrapper class is emitted for the return type and the method codegen path would reference a nonexistent type.
- fix(alef-backend-rustler): refactor method-call rendering to use a single `core_path` template variable instead of separate `core_import`/`struct_name`, fixing static method dispatch.
- fix(alef-e2e/kotlin): resolve `options_type` across language overrides (csharp/c/go/php/python) so Kotlin e2e tests pick up the correct options type without a redundant kotlin-specific override.
- fix(alef-backend-napi): napi capsule passthrough is now runtime-compatible with the `tree-sitter` npm package. The generated `getLanguage`-style shim now uses raw `napi_create_external` (the previous `napi::bindgen_prelude::External::new()` produced a wrapper that `Napi::Value::As<External<T>>` did not recognise), optionally calls `napi_type_tag_object` with a configurable GUID, and the property name is configurable (default `__parser`, set `property_name = "language"` to satisfy `node-tree-sitter`'s `UnwrapLanguage`). `NodeCapsuleTypeConfig` gains two optional fields: `property_name` (default `"__parser"` for back-compat) and `type_tag = { lower = "0x...", upper = "0x..." }`. Verified end-to-end in tree-sitter-language-pack: `getLanguage("python")` round-trips through `new Parser().setLanguage(lang).parse(...)` and yields the correct AST. Method-on-opaque-type capsule path remains a known limitation.

## [0.15.48] - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- chore(alef-core,alef-backend-php,alef-e2e): make `ResolvedCrateConfig::serde_rename_all_for_language` the single source of truth for per-language JSON wire casing. Flipped registry defaults so PHP, Kotlin, Swift, Dart return `camelCase` (matching their idiomatic variable conventions); Python/Ruby/Go/Elixir/R/Rust/Gleam/Zig/C/FFI stay `snake_case`. PHP backend's hard-coded `serde(rename_all = "camelCase")` now reads from the registry via a new `lang_rename_all` parameter threaded through `gen_php_struct`. Replaced `alef-e2e::codegen::normalize_json_keys_to_snake_case(value)` with `transform_json_keys_for_language(value, wire_case)` accepting any serde rename strategy; existing rust/c/kotlin callers pass `"snake_case"`, java codegen's `fromJson(...)` emission now transforms fixture keys to `"camelCase"` to match Jackson `@JsonProperty`, and php codegen's typed `from_json(json_encode([...]))` path uses `json_to_php_camel_keys` (also camelCase wire). This eliminates the band-aid "everything-to-snake" pre-pass and lets each binding receive JSON in the wire case its serde wrapper actually expects.

### Fixed

- fix(alef-e2e/c,alef-e2e/swift,alef-e2e/zig,alef-e2e/dart,alef-backend-zig): five codegen bugs that broke c/swift/zig/dart e2e tests. (1) c.rs: `render_chat_stream_test_function` redeclared `mock_base` for smoke+mock fixtures (those with `api_key_var`) where the env-fallback prologue already emits `api_key`/`base_url_buf` — caused "redefinition of `mock_base`" compile errors on `test_smoke_streaming_openai`. Now takes `api_key_var` and reuses the prologue's `api_key`/`base_url_buf` (matching the non-streaming client-factory path). (2) swift.rs: streaming fixtures fell through to the JS-style streaming_assertions fallback (`chunks.map((c: any) => ...).join('')`, `chunks.length`, `undefined`) because `collect_snippet` returns `None` for swift (swift-bridge doesn't yet expose a typed `chatStream` async sequence). Now emits an `XCTSkipIf` stub when the collect snippet is unavailable so the test target compiles. (3) zig.rs: `json_path_expr` didn't handle `[N]` indexed-segment notation, so `results[0].relevance_score` resolved to `object.get("results[0]")` instead of `.array.items[0]`; greater_than/less_than against fractional values (e.g. `0.9`) emitted `.integer` accessor causing "fractional component prevents float value '0.9' from coercion to type 'i64'" — now branches on whether the assertion value is a float and uses `.float`. (4) zig.rs: `build_args_and_setup` ignored per-call `extra_args` overrides, so `list_files()` / `list_batches()` invocations dropped the trailing optional `query: ?[]const u8` parameter — added merge logic mirroring go/python/swift. streaming_assertions deep-path for `tool_calls[N].xxx` returns None for zig (zig stores chunks as JSON strings, not typed records). (5) alef-backend-zig/opaque_handles.rs: `emit_method_param_conversion` didn't handle `Option<NamedStruct>` parameters — `dupeZ(u8, query)` requires a non-optional slice but the wrapper signature is `?[]const u8`, triggering "cannot convert optional to payload type" at `list_files`/`list_batches`. Now allocates conditionally (`if (query) |v| try dupeZ(...) else null`) and emits a null-aware `_from_json` call so `null` callers see `null` C handles. dart codegen: `field_to_dart_accessor` adds `!` after bracketed names so `choices![0]` / `toolCalls![0]` compile against `List<T>?`; `count_min`/`min_length`/`count_equals`/`max_length` use `?.length ?? 0`; `result_is_simple` config now honored so bytes-returning calls (speech, file_content) assert against the `Uint8List` directly rather than non-existent `.audio`/`.content` accessors.
- fix(alef-e2e/kotlin): test files emitted bareword imports (`import ChatCompletionRequest`, `import LiterLlm`) when the binding `class_name` wasn't fully-qualified, which Kotlin rejects with "Unresolved reference" since the kotlin binding emits typealiases at `kotlin_pkg_id` (e.g. `com.github.kreuzberg_dev`) and the test files live one package deeper at `<kotlin_pkg_id>.e2e` (parent-package symbols don't import implicitly). Now falls back to `kotlin_pkg_id` as the binding package when `import_path` is empty, producing `import com.github.kreuzberg_dev.ChatCompletionRequest` / `import com.github.kreuzberg_dev.LiterLlm`. Same fallback applied to options-type imports and CrawlConfig. Resolves the import layer in liter-llm kotlin e2e (remaining errors are coroutine `suspend fun` wrappers and nullable `Optional` accessors that need follow-up kotlin codegen work).
- fix(alef-e2e/java,alef-e2e/go): codegen bugs that broke streaming e2e tests for the Java and Go bindings. Java: (1) the `collect_snippet` emitted `new ArrayList<ChatCompletionChunk>()` but never imported `ChatCompletionChunk`, so the type erased to `Object` and downstream `c.choices()/ch.delta()` method calls failed with "cannot find symbol" — added an FQN import when any fixture is streaming. (2) `is_streaming` only checked `is_streaming_mock()`, so the `empty_stream` fixture (`stream_chunks:[]`) skipped the collect snippet and left `chunks` undefined at the assertion site — broadened to fire when any assertion references a streaming-virtual field, matching the kotlin/swift/php/python/elixir/typescript pattern. (3) The `not_error` arm for `byte[]` results emitted `Assertions.assertNotNull(...)` but only the static-import form (`assertNotNull`) is in scope — switched to the bare name. Go: (1) same `is_streaming` broadening so `empty_stream` drains the channel into `chunks`. (2) `needs_assert` for the file-level testify import treated streaming-virtual fields as `field_valid=false` (they don't resolve against the result type), so streaming-only files omitted the `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` import even though every assertion called `assert.X` — now field-valid is `true` when the assertion's field is a streaming-virtual reference on a streaming fixture. (3) `finish_reason` accessor returned `*last.Choices[0].FinishReason` without casting `FinishReason` (a `type FinishReason string` alias) back to `string`, causing E0308-style type mismatches at the assertion site — added an explicit `string(*...)` cast. (4) `tool_calls` accessor used `*ch.Delta.ToolCalls` but the Go binding declares `ToolCalls []StreamToolCall` (slice, not pointer); removed the bogus dereference and changed the IIFE return type to `[]pkg.StreamToolCall` so deep-path accessors like `tool_calls[0].function.name` index into the typed slice. (5) deep-path streaming-virtual equals on Go binding pointer-typed leaves (`StreamFunctionCall.Name *string`) now wraps the expression in a nil-safe deref IIFE so the comparison succeeds against the plain-string assertion value. Drops liter-llm go e2e from a build failure to 161/161 passing; the corresponding fix in `liter-llm/alef.toml` adds the missing `[crates.e2e.calls.chat_stream.overrides.go]` block so `chat_stream` requests are deserialised into the typed Go struct (the binding signature is `func (h *DefaultClient) ChatStream(req ChatCompletionRequest)`).
- fix(alef-e2e/php): four codegen bugs that broke streaming e2e tests for PHP bindings. (1) The `chunks` streaming-virtual-field accessor returned the bareword `chunks` for every language; PHP parses bareword identifiers as constant references, so generated code like `count(chunks)` triggered "Undefined constant" errors — added a PHP arm that emits `$chunks`. (2) `is_streaming` in `php.rs` only checked `is_streaming_mock()`, so fixtures like `empty_stream` (with `stream_chunks:[]`) skipped the collect snippet and left `$chunks` undefined at assertion sites — broadened to fire when any assertion references a streaming-virtual field, matching the elixir/python/kotlin/typescript pattern. (3) PHP binding's streaming method returns a JSON string of chunks (PHP cannot expose Rust iterators via ext-php-rs), but the collect snippet emitted `iterator_to_array(...)` which fails with `TypeError: Argument must be Traversable|array, string given` — now branches on `is_string($result)` to `json_decode` the string into stdClass objects, retaining `iterator_to_array` as a fallback for a future binding that exposes a real iterator. PHP `stream_complete` / `finish_reason` / `tool_calls` accessors and the deep-path tail renderer switched from camelCase to snake_case so they match the JSON wire-format property names on the decoded stdClass values. (4) Streaming fixtures whose only assertion is `not_error` (e.g. `stream_multiple_choices`) produced an empty assertions body, which PHPUnit flags as "risky" — emit a baseline `$this->assertTrue(is_array($chunks), 'expected drained chunks list')` so the test records a real assertion. Drops liter-llm php e2e from 12 errors to 0; all 161 tests pass with 308 assertions.
- fix(alef-e2e/streaming_assertions): three rust-codegen bugs that produced uncompilable e2e tests. (1) `is_streaming_virtual_field` matched the tail-suffix of any field whose chars-after-`root.len()` started with `.` or `[` without first checking `field.starts_with(root)`, so `choices[0].finish_reason` matched root `tool_calls` (chars 10+ begin with `.finish_reason`) and falsely triggered streaming-mode codegen on non-streaming fixtures — added the `starts_with` guard. (2) Rust `collect_snippet` left the chunks vector as `Vec<Result<ChatCompletionChunk, _>>`, so subsequent accessors like `chunks.iter().map(|c| c.choices...)` failed E0609 ("no field `choices` on `&Result<...>`") — now chains `.into_iter().map(|r| r.expect("stream item failed")).collect()` to yield `Vec<ChatCompletionChunk>`. (3) Rust `finish_reason` accessor used `.as_deref()` on `Option<FinishReason>` (an enum, not `String`) which fails E0599 — switched to `.as_ref().map(|v| v.to_string())`. (4) Rust deep-path `tool_calls[0].function.name` chained naive field access through `StreamToolCall { function: Option<StreamFunctionCall>, ... }` causing E0609 — added `render_rust_tool_calls_deep` helper that emits Option-aware chaining (`.nth(0).and_then(|x| x.function.as_ref()).and_then(|x| x.name.as_deref()).unwrap_or("")`). Drops liter-llm rust e2e from 266 compile errors to 0; all 152 tests pass.

### Added

- feat(alef-core,alef-backend-ffi): `ffi_skip_methods` on `TraitBridgeConfig` filters individual methods from the FFI vtable struct and `impl Trait for KreuzbergXBridge`. Methods whose signatures can't traverse the C FFI boundary (e.g. `Option<&dyn Trait>` returns like `DocumentExtractor::as_sync_extractor`) are dropped, falling back to the trait's default implementation. Configured per-bridge in `alef.toml`.
- feat(alef-backend-swift): trait-bridge support for trait methods that take excluded internal types by reference (e.g. `Renderer::render(&self, doc: &InternalDocument)`). Outbound trampolines now deserialise the JSON-bridged `String` parameter back to the source type using its fully-qualified Rust path (resolved via `type_paths`); inbound `impl Trait` blocks emit owned return types (`String` rather than the unsized `str`) so methods returning `Result<String>` compile. Lets the swift backend bridge `Renderer` alongside the other plugin traits.

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-extendr): trait-bridge codegen now compiles for R bindings. Six issues were fixed end-to-end: (1) generated `#[extendr]` registration/unregister/clear functions used `Result<(), String>` which is rejected as `extendr_api::Result<T>` only takes one generic parameter — switched to `std::result::Result<(), String>`; (2) `.map_err()` on `registry.write()` for `parking_lot::RwLockWriteGuard` (infallible) — dropped; (3) `Robj` is `!Send`/`!Sync` (raw `*mut SEXPREC`) but `Plugin: Send + Sync` is required — emit `unsafe impl Send + Sync` for the bridge struct with a SAFETY comment noting R's single-threaded contract; (4) async trait methods captured `Robj` directly into `tokio::spawn_blocking` closures which then failed the `F: Send` bound (RFC 2229 disjoint captures grab `r_obj.0` not the whole wrapper) — introduced a `SendRobj` newtype with `into_inner(self)` so the closure captures the whole `Send` wrapper; (5) sync/async complex-return templates called `serde_json::to_string(&val)` against `Robj` (no `Serialize` impl) — switched to expecting JSON-encoded `&str` payloads from R callbacks (callers serialise via `jsonlite::toJSON` on the R side); (6) `build_extendr_arg` had no branch for `TypeRef::Named` params (e.g. `Renderer::render(&self, doc: &InternalDocument)`) — now serialises Named-typed args to JSON strings before crossing the bridge. Unblocks removing `exclude_languages = ["r"]` from `OcrBackend`, `PostProcessor`, `Validator`, `EmbeddingBackend`, `DocumentExtractor`, and `Renderer` trait_bridges in downstream `alef.toml` configurations.
- fix(e2e/rust): skip primitive / std element_types (`String`, `str`, integer/float types, `bool`, `char`) when emitting `use {module}::{T};` statements. Fixtures that declare `element_type = "String"` were emitting `use kreuzberg::String;`, which triggered E0432 ("unresolved import `kreuzberg::String`"). Primitives are already in scope via the Rust prelude.
- fix(e2e/python,e2e/elixir): broaden `is_streaming` detection to also fire when an assertion references a streaming-virtual field (e.g. `empty_stream` has `stream_chunks:[]` so `is_streaming_mock()` returns false, but the fixture still asserts on `chunks`/`stream_content` which need the collect snippet). Mirrors the kotlin Phase-A pattern.
- fix(e2e/typescript,e2e/wasm): broaden `is_streaming` detection in the typescript test renderer (shared by both node and wasm e2e codegen) to also fire when an assertion references a streaming-virtual field. Previously the `empty_stream` fixture (which has `stream_chunks:[]`) skipped the `const stream = await client.chatStream(...)` binding and the `for await (_chunk of stream) chunks.push(_chunk)` collect block, leaving `chunks` undefined at the assertion site (`ReferenceError: chunks is not defined`). Mirrors the same fix already applied to python/elixir/kotlin.
- fix(codegen): backfill ffi_skip_methods field at TraitBridgeConfig construction sites
- fix(alef-backend-ffi): stop duplicating the `Plugin` super-trait impl in `gen_ffi_trait_impl`. The orchestrator (`trait_bridge::mod.rs`) already emits it before calling the trait impl path; emitting it again triggered E0119 ("conflicting implementations of trait `Plugin`") for every FFI trait bridge (`DocumentExtractor`, `Renderer`, `OcrBackend`, `PostProcessor`, `Validator`, `EmbeddingBackend`).
- fix(alef-backend-dart): skip static / associated methods (e.g. `T::default()`, `T::new()`) on opaque impl blocks. The emitter previously generated `pub fn name(&self) -> T { self.inner.name() }` for every method including statics, but calling an associated function with method syntax (`self.inner.default()`) trips E0599 ("this is an associated function, not a method").
- fix(alef-backend-dart): emit explicit conversion wrappers for opaque method returns where the core type doesn't match the FRB-widened bridge type. `&str` → `String`, `&Path` → `String` via `to_string_lossy`, `&[&str]` → `Vec<String>`, and `i32`/`u32`/`usize` → `i64`, `f32` → `f64` per FRB's primitive widening contract. Previously the body emitted bare `self.inner.method()` which produced E0308 ("mismatched types") for these returns.
- fix(alef-backend-dart): filter out non-serde types in the `create_<T>_from_json` shim emission. Types with `has_serde = false` in the IR (e.g. `MergedChunk`, `ResolvedStyle`, `CharShape`, `OdtProperties`, `OcrCacheStats`) can't be deserialised via `serde_json::from_str::<CoreT>` — emitting the shim triggered E0277 ("the trait bound `T: Deserialize` is not satisfied") at compile time.
- fix(alef-backend-dart): emit `cfg = None` on per-field assignments inside `From<CoreT> for MirrorT` impls. The dart bridge crate enables `features = ["full"]` on its kreuzberg dep, so every core-side cfg-gated field is present at compile time. Emitting `#[cfg(feature = "X")]` would gate on the dart crate's own (undefined) features — evaluating to false and leaving the struct literal missing fields like `code_intelligence`, `extracted_keywords`, `html_options`, etc.
- fix(alef-backend-dart): trait-bridge wrapper `supported_mime_types` now returns `&[&str]` instead of `Vec<String>` to match `DocumentExtractor::supported_mime_types(&self) -> &[&str]`. The Dart closure produces an owned `Vec<String>` that's materialised into `&'static [&'static str]` via `Box::leak` per call (same pattern as napi/pyo3 trait bridges, `alef-codegen::generators::trait_bridge::gen_method`).
- fix(alef-backend-swift): skip static / associated methods in `emit_extern_block_for_type_methods` and `emit_type_method_shims`. The shim signature is `pub fn type_method(client: &T)` and the body calls `client.0.method()` — calling associated functions like `T::default()` via the receiver trips E0599.
- fix(alef-backend-swift): handle `TypeRef::Path` returns with `.to_string_lossy().into_owned()` (instead of `.to_string()`, which doesn't exist on `&Path`) and `Vec<String>` + `returns_ref` returns (`&[&str]`) with `.iter().map(|s| s.to_string()).collect()` so methods like `TessdataManager::cache_dir() -> &Path` and `DocumentExtractor::supported_mime_types() -> &[&str]` compile.
- fix(alef-backend-zig): emit async Rust functions as synchronous Zig wrappers. The `!f.is_async` filter in the function-emission loop was re-introduced by the opaque-handle codegen commit, causing `scrape`, `crawl`, and `map_urls` (all `is_async: true` in the IR) to disappear from generated `kreuzcrawl.zig`. The Zig C FFI wraps every async function with `block_on`, so from Zig's perspective all functions are synchronous — the `is_async` flag is irrelevant at the Zig ABI level.
- fix(alef-e2e/dart): handle `[].` array traversal in assertion rendering. Field paths like `links[].url` and `links[].link_type` previously generated invalid Dart syntax (`links()[0].url()` type subscripts that fail `dart format`). Now generates correct `array.any((e) => e.field.toString().contains(val))` expressions for `contains`, `contains_all`, `not_contains`, and `not_empty` assertion types.



- fix(alef-backend-dart): emit `pub(crate) inner: {ty.rust_path}` on the FRB opaque wrapper struct instead of `{source_crate}::{name}`. The naive form only resolves for types re-exported at the crate root; `HwpxExtractor` lives at `kreuzberg::extractors::HwpxExtractor`, `TessdataManager` at `kreuzberg::ocr::TessdataManager`, etc., so the generated bridge failed to compile with `E0425: cannot find type X in crate kreuzberg` for ~12 opaque handles. Falls back to `{source_crate}::{name}` only when `rust_path` is empty. Template `rust_opaque_wrapper_struct.jinja` now takes `inner_path` directly.
- fix(alef-backend-dart): emit `pub use {qualified_path}` at the crate root for excluded types referenced by required trait-bridge method signatures (e.g. `InternalDocument`). FRB strips module paths from `frb_generated.rs` and resolves bare names via `use crate::*`, so these types must be visible at the crate root. The walk filters `trait_source.is_some()` and `has_default_impl` methods to match `emit_trait_bridge`'s required-method filter — avoids re-exporting traits referenced only by default-impl methods (e.g. `SyncExtractor` via `as_sync_extractor`), which would otherwise trigger `E0782: expected a type, found a trait` in FRB-generated closure types.
- fix(alef-backend-swift): gate `create_<type>(api_key, base_url)` constructor emission on `client_constructor_body` override presence in `alef.toml`. The default `(api_key, base_url) -> Result<T, String>` template only matches liter_llm-style clients; for plugin types like `HwpxExtractor::new()` and utilities like `TessdataManager::new(Option<PathBuf>)` it produced calls that didn't match the real Rust signature and broke compilation. Opaque types without an override are returned by Rust APIs, not constructed in Swift, so omitting the shim is the correct default.
- fix(alef-backend-java): filter `api.errors` variants whose generated class names collide with the FFI infrastructure exception names (`InvalidInputException`, `ConversionErrorException`). Both code paths in `JavaBackend::generate` were writing files at the same target paths; for `InvalidInputException` this produced malformed Java with a duplicate constructor block appended after the closing brace. Keeps the hardcoded infrastructure version canonical and drops the conflicting `gen_java_error_types` emission.
- fix(alef-codegen,backends): stop stripping cfg-gated struct fields from the binding. Previously `gen_struct_with_per_field_attrs`/`gen_struct_with_rename` and the napi/wasm backends dropped any field with `#[cfg(...)]`. The result was that `metadata: HtmlMetadata` and `images: Vec<InlineImage>` on `ConversionResult` (and similar feature-gated fields on other crates) disappeared from the binding struct even when the binding crate enabled the same feature. Binding crates already mirror the core crate's features via their `Cargo.toml`, so the cfg gate is redundant — the field is always present at compile time when the feature is on. The conversion sites and constructor helpers are still cfg-aware for trait-bridge `bind_via = "options_field"` fields (force-restored via `never_skip_cfg_field_names`), which carry binding-wrapper types that need `#[serde(skip)]` and `Default::default()` initialization. Restores `result.metadata` / `result.images` access on Python/Node/PHP/WASM bindings.
- fix(alef-codegen): `constructor_parts_with_renames` and `config_constructor_parts_inner` in `shared.rs` now emit a default expression (`None` for `Option<T>` fields, `Default::default()` otherwise) for cfg-gated fields in the struct-literal assignment list, while continuing to omit them from the parameter list. Completes the cfg-gated field story: the binding struct keeps the field (per the prior `gen_struct_*` fix), but the caller can't supply trait-bridge wrapper values, so the constructor body fills them with a default. Without this, Python/WASM/PHP bindings hit `E0063 missing field visitor / metadata / images` because the struct now requires the fields the constructor wasn't initializing. Mirrors the same defaulting pattern already used in `gen_struct_default_impl`. The php `Named` constructor in `alef-backend-php/src/gen_bindings/types.rs` (manual `param_init`) was updated to match.
- fix(alef-backend-pyo3): pass the visitor kwarg through to `_rust.<fn>` in generated api.py wrappers. For `bind_via = "options_field"` bridges, the python wrapper was stuffing the visitor into `options.visitor` via `_to_rust_<snake>(opts, _visitor_override=visitor)` but never forwarding `visitor=` to the underlying Rust function, which is what `gen_bridge_field_function` actually reads to wrap the bridge handle. The visitor was silently dropped; user-supplied visitor implementations had no effect.



### Added

- feat(e2e/swift): wire `StreamingFieldResolver` into swift codegen. Adds `"swift"` arms to `StreamingFieldResolver::accessor` (all seven virtual fields: `chunks`, `chunks.length`, `stream_content`, `stream_complete`, `no_chunks_after_done`, `tool_calls`, `finish_reason`) and `collect_snippet` (emits `var chunks: [ChatCompletionChunk] = []` / `for try await _chunk in result { ... }` drain loop). Adds `"swift"` to `render_deep_tail` field segment dispatch (snake_case method calls). Wires `is_streaming` detection in `render_test_method` and streaming-virtual field interception in `render_assertion` before the field-not-available guard. Eliminates ~30 `// skipped: field '...' not available on result type` comments from `StreamingTests.swift` and `SmokeTests.swift`. Adds 7 swift-specific unit tests.
- feat(alef-e2e/field_access): support user-typed array indices in fixture field paths — `choices[0].message.content` now parses as `Segment::ArrayField{name:choices,index:0}` → `Field(message)` → `Field(content)` instead of being treated as a literal dot-key. Wired through every per-language renderer so explicit indices are emitted correctly: Rust/Python/Go/Zig/C#/Swift/TS/PHP/Ruby/Dart use bracket notation `[N]`, Java emits `.get(N)`, Kotlin emits `.first()` for index 0 or `.get(N)` for others, Elixir emits `Enum.at(expr, N)`. Config-registered array fields without explicit `[N]` continue to default to index 0.
- feat(alef-backend-dart/frb-stream): implement FRB v2 `StreamSink<T>` streaming for the Dart backend. Sanitized methods with a matching `[[adapters]] pattern = "streaming"` entry in `alef.toml` now emit `#[frb] pub fn method_name(&self, params..., sink: StreamSink<ItemType>)` in the Rust bridge crate instead of being skipped. FRB v2 generates a `Stream<ItemType>` on the Dart side automatically. The generated Cargo.toml gains `futures-util = "0.3"` when any streaming adapter is configured. `supports_streaming` is now `true` in `DartBackend::capabilities()`.
- feat(alef-e2e/dart): streaming fixture support in the Dart e2e codegen. Fixtures with `mock_response.stream_chunks` now emit `await _client.method().toList()` instead of `await _client.method()`. Streaming assertions: `count_min` on `chunks` emits `expect(result.length, greaterThanOrEqualTo(N))`, `equals` on `stream_content` concatenates deltas and compares, error cases use `.toList()` in the `expectLater` lambda.
- feat(alef-backend-rustler): emit `#[rustler::nif] pub fn <snake_type>_from_json` shims that deserialize a JSON string via `serde_json::from_str`, convert to the binding type, and return `Result<TypeName, String>`. Enables Elixir e2e tests to deserialize typed request objects from JSON strings.
- feat(alef-e2e/swift): `options_via = "from_json"` support in Swift e2e test generation. When a call override sets `options_via = "from_json"` and `options_type = "<TypeName>"`, `build_args_and_setup` now emits `let _argName = try typeNameFromJson("<fixture-json>")` setup lines for `json_object` args instead of a `XCTSkipIf(true, "swift: json_object request construction requires options_via configuration ...")` skip stub. Handles `field = "input"` (entire fixture input is the request) correctly via `resolve_field`. Eliminates ~140 skip stubs in liter-llm swift e2e tests.
- feat(alef-backend-swift/gen_rust_crate): emit `{type_snake}_from_json(json: String) -> Result<TypeName, String>` free-function shims and extern "Rust" declarations for serde-enabled non-opaque types that appear as method parameters on opaque types. `collect_serde_param_types` scans both free-function params and `api.types[].methods[].params` to find these types. Enables `chatCompletionRequestFromJson`, `embeddingRequestFromJson`, etc. in the RustBridge Swift module.
- feat(alef-e2e/dart): dart assertion renderer reaches parity with rust/kotlin/go — all 24 fixture assertion types handled (was 5). Adds `render_dart()` and `render_dart_with_optionals()` to `FieldResolver` with proper per-segment camelCase conversion (FRB v2 convention), wired into `accessor()` and `render_accessor()` dispatch via a new `"dart"` arm. Replaces the single-pass `snake_to_camel` field path hack with `field_to_dart_accessor` for correct multi-segment path conversion.
- feat(e2e/streaming): support deep-nested paths in `StreamingFieldResolver` — `tool_calls[N].function.name`, `tool_calls[N].id`, and similar paths now resolve against the flat-mapped collected tool-calls list instead of emitting `// skipped:` comments. `split_streaming_deep_path` splits the root virtual field from the tail, `parse_tail` tokenises the tail into `Index`/`Field` segments, and `render_deep_tail` applies per-language navigation conventions (bracket for Rust/Go/TS/Python/PHP/C#/Kotlin/Dart/Swift/Ruby/Zig, `.get(N)` for Java, `Enum.at(expr, N)` for Elixir, `.items[N]` for Zig ArrayList, `.first()` for Kotlin index-0, `.ID`/`.URL` initialism expansion for Go). Covered by three new snapshot tests: `deep_tool_calls_function_name_snapshot_rust_kotlin_ts`, `deep_tool_calls_id_snapshot_all_langs`, and `deep_tool_calls_function_name_snapshot_python_elixir_zig`.

### Fixed

- fix(alef-e2e/java,csharp): assertion type 'not_error' on byte[] result now emits assertNotNull(result) / Assert.NotNull(result) instead of skipping. Eliminates 10 skipped comments across speech/transcribe fixtures.
- fix(alef-e2e/kotlin): substitute the field name in 'skipped: field {f} not available' comments instead of leaking the literal {f} placeholder. (Phase D eliminates these comments entirely for streaming-virtual fields.)
- fix(alef-backend-pyo3): import `has_default` config DTOs from `.options` even when they expose `Self`-returning builder methods. The api.py import classifier built `return_type_names` by walking method return types (and their transitive field references), which pulled config types like `PackConfig` (with `from_toml_file -> PackConfig`) and `ProcessConfig` (with `default`/`with_chunking`/`all`/`minimal` builders) out of `options_type_names`. The generated api.py then imported them from `._native`, breaking `mypy --strict` for any caller passing the re-exported dataclass. Use the IR-level `is_return_type` flag alone (set by alef-extract only for direct free-function returns), removing the over-broad method/field walk. Fixes [#72](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/alef/issues/72).
- fix(alef-e2e/java): `not_contains` assertions now handle the plural `values: [...]` array (symmetric to `contains_all`) in addition to the singular `value`. Previously, a fixture using `not_contains` with `values` produced `result.contains()` (empty argument) — a Java compile error. The codegen now wraps a singular `value` into a one-element list, and the jinja template loops over `values_java` emitting one `assertFalse(...contains(val))` call per entry.
- fix(alef-codegen): cfg-gated fields restored via trait-bridge `bind_via = "options_field"` now emit `#[serde(skip)]` and are propagated through both `binding→core` and `core→binding` From impls. Previously, restoring such a field (e.g. `visitor: Option<VisitorHandle>` on `ConversionOptions`) produced uncompilable bindings: the struct derived `serde::{Serialize, Deserialize}` over a non-serde-compatible bridge handle type, and the `From<Core>` impls omitted the field, so `Self { ... }` initializers were missing it. Adds `never_skip_cfg_field_names` to `ConversionConfig`, populated from `trait_bridges` by each backend.
- fix(alef-backend-napi,php): apply the trait-bridge `never_skip_cfg_field_names` mechanism added in alef-codegen so the NAPI (Node) and PHP bindings keep `bind_via = "options_field"` fields (e.g. `visitor` on `ConversionOptions`) instead of dropping them with the rest of the cfg-gated fields. Mirrors the existing PyO3 backend behavior.
- fix(alef-backend-ffi,php): emit `*result` (Copy) for `TypeRef::Char` and `result.to_vec()` for `TypeRef::Vec/Map` slice returns in `gen_method_wrapper`, instead of `result.clone()` (clippy noop on `&char` and unsized slices). Also emit `.to_string()` rather than `.clone()` for `&str` params before moving into `spawn_blocking` closures (avoids E0521 borrow-escape).
- fix(pyo3): emit `error_to_py_err` directly in `.map_err()` (no redundant closure) — avoids clippy `redundant_closure` in generated bindings.
- fix(pyo3): api.py import order — stdlib `from typing import …` first, then `import _rust as _rust`, then capsule-type imports (e.g. `from tree_sitter import Language`), then locals.
- fix(pyo3): api.py wraps capsule-returning calls in `cast("Type", …)` for mypy strict mode; adds `cast` to the typing import only when needed.
- fix(pyo3): skip capsule types in `.pyi` stubs (they live in third-party packages); conditional `from typing import …` based on actual usage — avoids RUF100 for the old unconditional four-name import. Method stubs on opaque types (e.g. `LanguageRegistry.get_language`) also substitute `Any` for capsule-typed params/returns. Suppresses PYI029 on the data-enum class wrappers' `__str__`/`__repr__` — the pyo3 wrapper implements them via Display/Debug and callers rely on `str(value)` returning the serde tag.
- feat(alef-backend-napi): `capsule_types` support for raw-pointer passthrough into external tree-sitter libraries (e.g. the `tree-sitter` npm package). Types listed under `[crates.node.capsule_types]` are excluded from opaque `#[napi]` class emission; functions returning them instead emit a `#[napi]` shim that calls `value.into_raw()`, wraps the pointer in `env.create_external(ptr, None)`, and sets it as `__parser` on a returned `JsObject`. TypeScript declaration stubs emit `import type { T } from "module"` and use the ecosystem type name directly in function signatures.
- fix(pyo3): drop redundant `pass` body for empty-field types in generated `options.py` — `pass` after a docstring triggers ruff PIE790.
- fix(wasm): add `#[allow(clippy::should_implement_trait)]` to inherent `default()` factory method; renaming would change the JS-visible API.
- fix(java): marshal `Path` params via `.toString()` in opaque-type stream-method bodies — previously lumped with `String`/`Char`/`Json` whose template does not call `.toString()`, causing a Java type mismatch.

## [0.15.44] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- feat(alef-core/java): `[java] group_id` and `[java] artifact_id` config overrides for the Maven coords emitted by `alef-scaffold/java`. When unset, `java_group_id()` falls back to the Java package and `java_artifact_id()` falls back to the source crate name. Set these when the published Maven coords need to differ from the Java package / source crate name (e.g. crate `html-to-markdown-rs` publishes as artifactId `html-to-markdown` under groupId `dev.kreuzberg`).

### Fixed

- fix(alef-e2e/zig): drop the misleading `// Note: async functions not yet fully supported; treating as sync` comment from generated tests in all three emission paths (error, no-assertion, happy). The generated tests already exercise the real async code path via `tokio::runtime::block_on` in the FFI shim, so the comment was cosmetic noise.
- fix(alef-e2e/kotlin): remove the dead `call_overrides.is_none()` short-circuit that emitted `Assumptions.assumeTrue(false, "TODO: implement Kotlin e2e test")` for every fixture lacking a per-call override. The existing fallback resolves `function_name`/`result_var`/`args` from `call_config.function.to_lower_camel_case()` and the global `[e2e.call.overrides.kotlin]` block, so the real assertion renderer is now reachable for all kotlin fixtures. Also extend `client_factory` lookup to fall back to the global block (mirrors dart pattern), so per-call kotlin overrides don't lose the global `createClient` factory.
- fix(alef-e2e/dart): emit `expect(...)` assertion calls after the `await` in the non-HTTP test path. Previously the renderer dropped the result on the floor (`final result = await ...;` with no following assertions). Added `render_assertion_dart` helper handling `equals`, `field_equals`, `contains`, `not_null`, `not_error`; unknown assertion types emit a `// skipped:` comment as before.

## [0.15.43] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-go): emit gofmt-clean output from the visitor templates — `visitor_preamble.jinja` now ends with a trailing newline (so `gofmt` doesn't insert a blank line between the import block and the first declaration), and `visitor_registry_block.jinja` aligns the `visitorRegistry`/`visitorIDCounter` field types so `gofmt` doesn't realign them. Without this, the alef-verify pre-commit hook fails because `gofmt` reformats the regen output and the resulting hash no longer matches the `alef:hash` header.

## [0.15.42] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-go): prepend `C.` to all cgo function calls and the options struct type in the visitor helper template. Previously `convert_with_visitor_helper.jinja` emitted bare identifiers (`htm_conversion_options_from_json(...)`, `htm_options_set_visitor(...)`, `htm_convert(...)`, etc.) which Go treated as undefined package-level functions, breaking the entire Go binding with `undefined: htm_*` errors. Now matches the existing `binding.go` convention of `C.htm_*` for cgo symbol resolution.

## [0.15.41] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-wasm): emit a real newline after the rustdoc block so `#[derive(Clone, Default)]` no longer ends up concatenated inside the `///` comment line. Previously every `Wasm*` binding struct silently lost its `Clone`/`Default` derives because the template's `{%- endfor %}` stripped the newline between rustdoc lines and the subsequent attribute, causing `error[E0277]: the trait bound 'WasmDocumentMetadata: Default' is not satisfied` (and many like it) at compile time.
- fix(alef-backend-pyo3): skip the `options.{visitor}` fallback in the convert wrapper when the bridge field is `#[cfg(...)]`-gated and therefore absent from the binding struct. Previously the fallback was inserted unconditionally and produced `error[E0609]: no field 'visitor' on type '&ConversionOptions'`.
- fix(alef-backend-napi): gate `find_options_field_binding` on the bridge field being present in the binding struct. When the core field is cfg-gated and stripped from the binding, fall back to the regular function generator instead of emitting an options-field bridge that references a missing field.

## [0.15.40] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- fix(alef-e2e/php): `not_contains` assertions now handle the plural `values: [...]` array (symmetric to `contains_all`) in addition to the singular `value`. Previously, a fixture using `not_contains` with `values` produced `assertStringNotContainsString(, $result)` — an empty-first-argument PHP parse error. The codegen now wraps a singular `value` into a one-element list, and the jinja template loops over `values_php` emitting one `assertStringNotContainsString` call per entry.
- fix(alef-backend-dart): use `From<MirrorT> for CoreT` conversion instead of `unsafe transmute` in opaque-type method bodies for types whose mirror layout differs from the core layout. The `has_layout_mismatch` detection now covers Duration, Path, Json (serde_json::Value → String, 32 vs 24 bytes), and non-identity primitive widening (e.g. u32 → i64, 4 vs 8 bytes). The transitive-closure computation (`compute_types_needing_from_impl`) is extended to process enum variant field types so that types like `SystemMessage` and `ToolChoiceMode` (reachable through `Message` and `ToolChoice` from `ChatCompletionRequest`) also get `From<MirrorT> for CoreT` impls. Additionally, `String` method parameters marked `is_ref` now correctly pass `&param_name` to core methods that take `&str`. `Bytes`-returning methods chain `.to_vec()` to convert `bytes::Bytes` to `Vec<u8>`.
- fix(alef-backend-dart): emit `create_<snake>_from_json(json: String) -> Result<TypeName, String>` free bridge functions for all non-opaque mirror struct types. These allow e2e tests to construct typed request objects from JSON without manually populating every field — required because FRB bridge methods use named parameters that cannot accept bare JSON strings. FRB generates the corresponding `createTypeNameFromJson(json: '...')` top-level Dart function from these annotated Rust stubs.
- fix(alef-e2e/dart): pass `String`-typed method arguments as Dart named parameters (`paramName: 'value'`) instead of positional arguments — FRB v2 generates all bridge method parameters as `{required T name}` named params in Dart, so positional passing produced `extra_positional_arguments_could_be_named` compile errors.
- fix(alef-e2e/dart): add `dart` to `chat_stream` `skip_languages` — the `chat_stream` method has a sanitized `BoxStream` return type that cannot be bridged through FRB, so the method is absent from the generated Dart class and streaming tests cannot be emitted. Skipping them matches the `go` treatment.
- fix(alef-e2e): fix `retrieve_response` and `cancel_response` call configs to use `field = "input.response_id"` — the liter-llm fixtures store the response identifier under `input.response_id`, not `input.id`, so the previous config caused "missing required input field 'id'" warnings and generated invalid no-argument calls in every language backend.

- fix(alef-e2e/swift): emit `try XCTSkipIf(true, ...)` stub for test methods whose call has a `json_object` arg without an `options_via` construction mechanism — previously the codegen passed `nil` or a bare JSON string literal, producing a Swift compile error (`'nil' is not compatible with expected argument type 'ChatCompletionRequest'` / `cannot convert value of type 'String' to expected argument type 'EmbeddingRequest'` etc.). Affects `chat`, `embed`, `speech`, `transcribe`, `image_generate`, `moderate`, `rerank`, `search`, `ocr`, `create_batch`, `create_file`, `create_response`, and `chat_stream` calls in liter-llm. The skipped tests compile and are recorded as XCTest skips rather than compile failures.
- fix(alef-e2e/swift): use `CharacterSet.whitespaces` instead of `.whitespaces` in all `trimmingCharacters(in:)` calls — Swift's type inference cannot always resolve the member shorthand inside `XCTAssertEqual` overloads, producing `error: cannot infer contextual base in reference to member 'whitespaces'`. The explicit `CharacterSet.whitespaces` is always unambiguous.
- fix(alef-e2e/swift): honour `extra_args` from per-call language overrides in the Swift e2e codegen — previously `extra_args = ["nil"]` entries in `[e2e.calls.<name>.overrides.swift]` were silently ignored, causing calls such as `listFiles()` and `listBatches()` to omit the required (but optional-typed) query parameter and fail with `error: missing argument for parameter #1 in call`. The fix appends verbatim extra args after the normal argument list, mirroring the existing behaviour in Go, Java, Ruby, and Gleam backends.
- fix(alef-e2e/swift): correctly handle `[N]` array subscripts in `swift_build_accessor` — segments containing an index (e.g. `data[0]`) were naively appended as `data[0]()` instead of the correct `data()[0]`, producing a Swift compile error. The segment is now split at `[` so the method call `()` is placed before the subscript.
- fix(alef-e2e/swift): read per-language `result_is_simple` override in swift codegen — the flag was only read from the base `CallConfig`, ignoring `[e2e.calls.<name>.overrides.swift] result_is_simple = true` entries. Calls such as `file_content` that return `Data` (not a struct) were incorrectly attempting to access `result.content().toString()`, producing a Swift compile error. The fix mirrors ruby's resolution: `base || override || global`.
- fix(alef-e2e/swift): merge per-call `enum_fields` keys from swift overrides into the effective enum set for each test method — fields like `"status"` (type `BatchStatus`) were not in the global `fields_enum` and so generated `.toString()` on the opaque `RustBridge.BatchStatus` class (which has no such method), producing a compile error. The fix builds a `Cow<HashSet<String>>` that extends the global set with the per-call override keys, then uses `String(describing:)` for those fields.
- fix(alef-e2e/swift): emit `XCTAssertFalse(result.isEmpty, ...)` for `not_empty` assertions when `result_is_simple = true` — previously the code path fell through to `result.toString().isEmpty`, which fails to compile when the result type is `Data` (no `.toString()` method). The fix detects `result_is_simple` before the string-conversion branch and calls `.isEmpty` directly on the result variable, which is valid for both `String` and `Data`.
- fix(alef-e2e/dart): remove erroneous `call_config.id` field references introduced by the dart agent — `CallConfig` has no `id` field, causing a compile error `no field 'id' on type '&CallConfig'`. The `.or_else` fallback branches that used this field were redundant (the primary `call_overrides` resolution already reads the correct per-fixture per-language override) and are now removed.

- fix(alef-backends/visitor): preserve original-case string in the `VisitResult::Custom` variant across `pyo3`, `napi`, `magnus`, `php`, `extendr`, and `wasm` trait-bridge templates. The dispatch match was binding the already-lowercased string to `other` and using it as the `Custom` payload, so user-returned bare strings like `"[Download](url)"` were emitted as `"[download](url)"`. The fallback arm now returns `Custom(s)` (or `Custom(s.to_string())` for `&str` sources). Fixes kreuzberg-dev/html-to-markdown#350.
- fix(alef-scaffold/php): emit `php-ext.download-url-method = ["pre-packaged-binary", "composer-default"]` in the scaffolded `packages/php/composer.json` so PIE 1.4.x discovers pre-built binaries attached to GitHub releases instead of falling through to source-build via `phpize` (which has no `config.m4` for ext-php-rs extensions). Fixes kreuzberg-dev/html-to-markdown#333.
- fix(alef-backend-kotlin): wrap opaque-handle client types as coroutine-friendly Kotlin classes that delegate to a sibling Java instance instead of calling non-existent `Bridge.<type>_<method>(handle, ...)` static methods. The previous generator emitted `class DefaultClient(apiKey, baseUrl)` with `private val handle: Long = Bridge.default_client_new(...)` and `Bridge.default_client_chat(handle, req)` calls — but the Java FFM backend exposes those FFI symbols only as instance methods on the Java `DefaultClient`, not as flat statics on the facade. The wrapper now takes `internal val inner: <java_package>.<ClassName>` and delegates each method as `withContext(Dispatchers.IO) { inner.<method>(args) }`. Construction flows through the existing facade factories (e.g. `LiterLlm.createClient(...)` now wraps the returned Java instance). Methods whose IR signature was sanitized (e.g. `chat_stream` whose real Java return type is a custom `Iterator<Chunk>`) are skipped — they require backend-specific surfaces that the generic generator cannot synthesize. Trait types and non-opaque value types (e.g. kreuzberg's `ExtractionConfig` with only a `default()` static) keep flowing through the Java typealias as before.
- fix(alef-backend-kotlin): exclude types-with-methods from `typealias` emission so the new Kotlin wrapper class does not collide with `typealias DefaultClient = <java>.DefaultClient` in the same package (was producing `Redeclaration: DefaultClient` from `compileKotlin`). The exclusion is gated on `is_opaque && !is_trait && has(non_sanitized, non_static method)` so kreuzberg's value-type configs keep their existing alias surface.
- fix(alef-backend-kotlin): emit `= null` defaults for optional flat-function parameters on the facade `object` so callers can use named-argument syntax (`LiterLlm.createClient(apiKey = "x", baseUrl = "y")`) without spelling out every nullable downstream argument.
- fix(alef-e2e/kotlin): client-factory smoke tests now invoke the configured factory function as `<class>.<client_factory>(apiKey, baseUrl)` (e.g. `LiterLlm.createClient(...)`) rather than calling the class name as a constructor — the latter produced `LiterLlm(apiKey, ...)` against the singleton facade `object` and failed to compile.
- fix(alef-backend-swift): emit `use <trait_path>;` statements in generated `lib.rs` for every trait-provided method on opaque-handle types — without these, `client.0.chat(req)` fails with `no method named 'chat' found for struct DefaultClient; perhaps trait LlmClient is implemented but not in scope`. Imports are collected from `MethodDef.trait_source` (None for inherent methods) and de-duplicated per type.
- fix(alef-backend-swift): correct call-site handling of opaque-method arguments — `Option<Named>` newtype args now emit `arg.map(|v| v.0)` instead of the invalid `arg.0`, `&str`/`&Path`-typed args (marked `is_ref` in IR) now emit `&arg` instead of moving the owned `String`, and `Bytes`-returning methods now chain `.map(|b| b.to_vec())` so `bytes::Bytes` converts to the `Vec<u8>` swift-bridge expects on the bridge boundary.
- fix(alef-backend-swift): allow per-type override of the auto-generated `create_<type>(api_key, base_url)` constructor body via `[crates.<crate>.swift] client_constructor_body."TypeName" = "…"`. Required for source crates whose constructor signature differs from the hardcoded `Type::new(api_key, base_url)` shape — e.g. liter-llm's `DefaultClient::new(ClientConfig, Option<&str>)`.
- fix(alef-backend-swift): only inject the implicit `ocr-wasm` cargo feature when the umbrella source crate actually exposes it in its on-disk `Cargo.toml`. Previously the unconditional injection caused `error: package liter-llm-swift depends on liter-llm with feature 'ocr-wasm' but liter-llm does not have that feature` for crates without an OCR module.
- fix(alef-backend-swift): drop argument labels in the `DefaultClient.init` -> bridge constructor call — swift-bridge emits the free `createDefaultClient(_:_:)` function without parameter labels, so the host wrapper now calls it positionally. Bytes-returning host wrapper methods bind the result locally and wrap in `Data(bytes.map { $0 })` to convert from `RustVec<UInt8>`.
- fix(alef-backend-dart,alef-backend-swift): emit explicit `package = "..."` rename in generated `Cargo.toml` `[dependencies]` block when the umbrella crate's Rust ident form (e.g. `liter_llm`) differs from the on-disk cargo package name (e.g. `liter-llm`). Without this, `liter_llm = { path = "..." }` causes `error: no matching package found — searched: liter_llm; perhaps you meant: liter-llm`. The fix is symmetrical across both backends and only fires when no explicit `core_crate_override` is set. (Swift had the rename logic in place but the new `core_crate_dir` argument was not wired through the cargo emitter — both sides are now consistent.)
- fix(alef-backend-dart): bump generated Dart pubspec SDK constraint to `>=3.3.0 <4.0.0`. `flutter_rust_bridge` 2.x emits `extension type` declarations in the WASM-side `frb_generated.web.dart`, which the Dart analyser rejects on SDKs below 3.3. Lower SDKs analyse cleanly for native-only builds but fail when the `.web.dart` file is in scope (always, since FRB emits it unconditionally). Same constraint now propagates to the alef-e2e dart pubspec template.
- fix(alef-backend-dart): emit static-wrapper signatures with required parameters as positional and optional parameters inside a `{...}` named-parameter block. Previously every param was positional, forcing callers (and the e2e codegen, which emits `createClient('test-key', baseUrl: mockUrl)`) to compile-fail with `not_enough_positional_arguments` / `undefined_named_parameter`. Functions with the special `ExtractionConfig` param (kreuzberg) keep the existing `[ExtractionConfig? config]` optional-positional shape — the new logic only applies to all-other-functions.
- fix(alef-backend-zig): emit iterator-based streaming method bodies — previously `chat_stream` was emitted as a generic method that called the callback-based C symbol `literllm_default_client_chat_stream(client, req_handle)` with only 2 arguments, producing a Zig compile error "expected 4 argument(s), found 2". Streaming adapters (pattern = "streaming") now detect the matching `Streaming` adapter config, derive the item type, and emit a `_start`/`_next`/`_free` iterator body that collects chunks, keeping the last chunk JSON as the return value (or `"{}"` on an empty stream). The detection is fully generic — any method named in a `Streaming` adapter in `alef.toml` receives the iterator body.
- fix(alef-backend-zig): emit multi-out-parameter convention for `Bytes` return types in both flat-function and opaque-method codegen — the C FFI returns `int32_t` status and writes the buffer via three out-params (`uint8_t **out_ptr, uintptr_t *out_len, uintptr_t *out_cap`); the zig wrapper now declares `var _out_ptr: [*c]u8 = undefined; var _out_len: usize = 0; var _out_cap: usize = 0;`, passes `&_out_ptr, &_out_len, &_out_cap` as extra C args, copies the buffer into a caller-owned `[]u8` via `std.heap.c_allocator.dupe`, and releases the FFI allocation via `{prefix}_free_bytes`. `zig_return_type` now maps `TypeRef::Bytes` to `[]u8` (owned) rather than `[]const u8`. Unblocks `speech` / `file_content` and any other library method returning `Result<Vec<u8>, _>`.
- fix(alef-e2e/gleam): fix four compile errors in generated Gleam e2e test files:
  1. `client_factory` calls now emit `option.None` (or `option.Some(base_url)`) instead of `""` for the `base_url` arg, and accept a new `client_factory_trailing_args` key on `[e2e.call.overrides.<lang>]` so consumers can pad extra positional parameters (e.g. `["option.None", "option.None", "option.None"]` for liter-llm's 5-arg `create_client`).
  2. `json_object` args without an `element_constructors` recipe or `json_object_wrapper` now emit a `// skipped` stub instead of a bare JSON-string literal that fails to typecheck against typed record parameters (`ChatCompletionRequest`, `EmbeddingRequest`, etc.).
  3. `extra_args` from per-call language overrides are now appended to the generated argument list; consumers can use `extra_args = ["option.None"]` to supply required-but-fixture-absent parameters such as the optional `query` argument on `list_files` / `list_batches`.
  4. Array-element field assertions (`data[1].field`, `pages[2].field`, etc.) are now correctly skipped — previously only `[0].` and `[].` patterns were matched; the fix uses a regex-free digit scan so any `[N].` index is recognised.
  Additionally: `equals` assertions on fields listed in the effective enum-field set (global `fields_enum` merged with per-call `enum_fields` / `assert_enum_fields`) now emit a `// skipped` comment in Gleam instead of generating a string comparison against a sum-type value that does not typecheck. Per-call `result_is_simple = true` overrides now cause field-access assertions to be skipped when the return type is a primitive (e.g. `BitArray`) with no record fields.
- fix(alef-backend-gleam): skip non-trait types with methods from the regular data-type emission pass — they are now emitted exclusively as opaque NIF resource handles (`pub opaque type T { T(resource: dynamic.Dynamic) }`). Previously such types were emitted twice (once as a phantom record by `emit_type` and once as an opaque resource by `emit_resource_type`), producing a "Duplicate type definition" compile error from `gleam build`.
- fix(alef-backend-zig): emit synthetic `free()` destructor on opaque-handle structs — every opaque handle owns a heap allocation in the FFI and must be released via the matching `{prefix}_{snake}_free` C symbol; `emit_opaque_handle` now appends a `pub fn free(self: *T) void` that calls the destructor, so `defer _client.free();` in generated e2e tests resolves correctly.
- fix(alef-backend-zig): remove spurious leading `!` on opaque-method signatures — the emit template was producing a double error union `!(LiterLlmError||error{OutOfMemory})![]u8` which Zig 0.16 rejects with "type does not support field access"; corrected to a single error union.
- fix(alef-backend-zig): map FFI errors to declared error set via `_first_error` — opaque-method error path was returning `error.FfiError` which isn't in the function's declared error set; aligned with flat-function codegen by calling `_first_error({error_type})`.
- fix(alef-e2e/zig): auto-set `result_is_json_struct` when `client_factory` is configured — opaque-method results are always serialized to JSON `[]u8` by the zig backend, so the e2e test must parse them with `std.json.parseFromSlice` rather than expecting a typed Zig struct.
- fix(alef-backend-zig): emit async opaque-handle methods — the `is_async` guard in `emit_opaque_method` was incorrectly skipping all methods whose Rust source is `async` even though the C FFI wraps them as synchronous functions via `block_on`; removed the guard so all non-static methods are emitted.
- fix(alef-backend-zig): correct optional-integer FFI marshalling — `?u64`/`?u32` (and any `Optional(Primitive)`) parameters now emit `if (x) |v| v else std.math.maxInt(T)` to pass the sentinel value the Rust FFI uses for `None`, instead of passing the `?T` type directly to a non-optional C parameter.
- fix(alef-backend-zig): wrap opaque-handle function return in Zig struct — `create_client` and similar functions that return an opaque C pointer now emit `TypeName{ ._handle = _result.? }` instead of returning the raw nullable C pointer, matching the `_handle: *anyopaque` field type.
- fix(alef-backend-zig): fix unreachable-code in opaque-method error block — `_ = _msg;` was emitted after `return error.FfiError;`; reordered to suppress the unused-variable warning before the early return.
- fix(alef-backend-zig): use `{prefix}_last_error_context` (not `_message`) in opaque-method error path — the C FFI exposes `_last_error_context`, not `_last_error_message`.

### Added

- feat(alef-e2e/visitor): `CallbackAction::CustomTemplate` gains a `return_form` field (`"dict"` (default) or `"bare_string"`). When set to `"bare_string"`, the generated test visitor method returns the rendered template directly as a string (e.g. `return f'…'` in Python, `` return `…` `` in TS/WASM, `"#{…}"` in Ruby, the raw string in PHP/R) so the trait-bridge's bare-string return path is exercised — instead of the dict/object wrapper that all existing fixtures relied on. Default behaviour is unchanged.
- feat(zig): client-object/opaque-handle codegen — types with non-empty `TypeDef.methods` that are opaque or non-serde now emit a Zig `pub const TypeName = struct { _handle: *anyopaque, ... }` with one `pub fn` per non-static, non-async method, dispatching via `c.{prefix}_{snake_type}_{snake_method}`. Driven by `CallOverride.client_factory` in e2e; no special-casing per library.
- feat(zig e2e): `[e2e.call.overrides.zig].client_factory` support — when set, generated Zig test functions instantiate a client via `module.factory_fn("test-key", mock_url, ...)` and call methods on the `_client` instance instead of calling the top-level module function directly. Mirrors the Go/Swift/Kotlin/Dart client-factory pattern.

- feat(gleam): opaque-resource codegen — types with non-empty `TypeDef.methods` now emit `pub opaque type TypeName { TypeName(resource: dynamic.Dynamic) }` plus one `@external` NIF binding per method. Mirrors the Swift/Kotlin/Dart client-object pattern.
- feat(gleam e2e): `[e2e.call.overrides.gleam].client_factory` support — when set, generated Gleam tests call the factory function and pass the client as the first argument to the method under test.
- fix(gleam e2e): Erlang startup shim now uses a `case` expression with a graceful `{error, _} -> ok` fallback when starting the Elixir application, avoiding test failures in environments without an Elixir runtime dependency.

- feat(dart e2e): `[e2e.call.overrides.dart].client_factory` support — when set, generated `package:test` tests call `await {BridgeClass}.{factory}('test-key', baseUrl: mockUrl)` before the assertion and dispatch the method on the resulting `_client` instance. Mirrors the Go/TypeScript/Zig/Swift/Kotlin client-factory pattern; no special-casing per library.

### Changed

- refactor(dart): `[crates.dart].stub_methods` is now a config-driven list of method names whose Rust bridge body is replaced with `unimplemented!()`. Previously this behaviour was hardcoded to kreuzberg's `batch_extract_bytes` / `batch_extract_bytes_sync`. **Migration**: if your `alef.toml` relied on the hardcoded list, add `stub_methods = ["batch_extract_bytes", "batch_extract_bytes_sync"]` (or the relevant names) under `[crates.<name>.dart]`.

### Known limitations

- FRB codegen still requires a manual post-step after `alef generate`: `cd packages/dart/rust && cargo run --bin flutter_rust_bridge_codegen`. Implementing a `PostBuildStep` for this is deferred to a future release.
- The dart backend does NOT yet emit instance methods on opaque-type wrappers in the FRB Rust crate. When a type has `TypeDef.methods` (e.g. `DefaultClient::chat`, `::embed`, `::list_models` in liter-llm), only the empty `#[frb(opaque)] pub struct DefaultClient { inner: ... }` wrapper is emitted — FRB then generates an `abstract class DefaultClient implements RustOpaqueInterface {}` with no callable methods. The swift/kotlin/zig/gleam backends already implement this (driven by `TypeDef.methods` + `[e2e.call.overrides.<lang>].client_factory`); the dart equivalent — emitting `impl DefaultClient { #[frb] pub fn chat(&self, req: ChatCompletionRequest) -> Result<ChatCompletionResponse, String> { ... } }` blocks so FRB surfaces them as Dart instance methods — is the natural next step but is deferred. Until then, dart e2e tests for libraries with stateful clients (liter-llm) will not compile past the `_client.chat()` call sites even though the static factory (`createClient`) and all data-type mirrors generate correctly.

### Added

- feat(swift): client-object class wrapper — types with non-empty `TypeDef.methods` now emit a `public final class TypeName` with an `init(apiKey:baseUrl:)` constructor and one `public func method(...)` per method, backed by free-function shims in the swift-bridge crate (`create_<type>` / `<type>_<method>`). Driven by `TypeDef.methods` in the IR; no special-casing per library.
- feat(swift e2e): `[e2e.call.overrides.swift].client_factory` support — when set, generated XCTest methods instantiate `DefaultClient(apiKey:baseUrl:)` against the mock server URL and call `client.<method>(args)` instead of a free function. Mirrors the Go/TypeScript/Zig client-factory pattern.
- feat(swift e2e): `Package.swift` now always emits `.iOS(.v14)` alongside `.macOS(...)` in the platforms array; swift-bridge supports both targets.
- feat(kotlin): client-object class codegen — types with non-empty `TypeDef.methods` now emit a `DefaultClient.kt` with a `class DefaultClient(apiKey, baseUrl?)` constructor, one method per `MethodDef`, and `AutoCloseable.close()` delegating to `Bridge.<type>_free(handle)`. Driven entirely by IR; flat-function Kotlin (kreuzberg) is unaffected.
- feat(kotlin e2e): `[e2e.call.overrides.kotlin].client_factory` support — when set, generated JUnit 5 tests instantiate `DefaultClient(apiKey, baseUrl)` against the mock server URL and call `client.<method>(args)` followed by `client.close()`, mirroring the Go/TypeScript/Zig pattern.
- feat(kotlin kmp): KMP `build.gradle.kts` now emits `iosX64`, `iosArm64`, `iosSimulatorArm64` (framework binaries) and `androidNativeArm64` (sharedLib) targets with cinterop blocks; corresponding `iosMain` and `androidNativeArm64Main` sourceSets wired to `nativeMain`.
- feat(kotlin mode): `KotlinConfig` gains `pub mode: Option<String>` field — accepted values `"jvm"` (default), `"kmp"`, `"android"`. Setting `mode = "android"` emits an Android library project under `packages/kotlin-android/` (minSdk 21, compileSdk 35, `AndroidManifest.xml`).

### Note

- XCFramework `binaryTarget` codegen (pre-built `.xcframework` distribution for SwiftPM) is deferred as a follow-up; the current output requires local `cargo build` to produce the Rust dylib.

## [0.15.39] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- feat(alef-backend-pyo3): `[crates.python.extra_init_imports]` re-exports hand-written Python symbols (e.g. literal type aliases generated by user scripts) through `__init__.py` without alef culling them. Schema: `{ "<module>" = ["<symbol>", ...] }`. Symbols are appended to `__all__` and the source modules are skipped by the cleanup pipeline.

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-pyo3): capsule-typed return values now Python-construct the declared `python_type` instead of returning a bare `PyCapsule`. Both the `Capsule(...)` and `ConstructFrom { python_type, construct_from }` config variants now produce real `tree_sitter.Language` / `tree_sitter.Parser` instances at the call site, restoring `parser.parse(bytes)` semantics in downstream Python bindings. Also filters capsule types out of generated `from ._native import …` statements in `api.py` and `__init__.py`, since they have no native Rust class to import.

## [0.15.38] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- fix(hooks): `alef_hook.py` now honours `[crate].version_from = "Cargo.toml"` in `alef.toml` and resolves the version from the referenced Cargo.toml's `[workspace.package]` (or `[package]`) `version` field. Previously the hook always read the top-level `version = "..."` line in alef.toml, which is a stale lazily-bumped fallback — downstream consumers tried to download `alef-<host>.tar.gz` for that stale version and 404'd. Falls back to the inline `version` line if the referenced Cargo.toml is missing.

## [0.15.37] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-dart): `doc_comment.jinja` now preserves newlines between doc-comment lines. Under `trim_blocks = true`, `{%- endfor %}` was stripping the newline before the tag, collapsing multi-line doc comments into a single line in the generated Dart wrapper class (e.g. `packages/dart/lib/src/<module>.dart`). Same class of bug as the prior `alef-backend-zig` fix in 0.15.36 (`error_doc_block.jinja`, `trait_method_doc_lines.jinja`).

## [0.15.36] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- refactor(alef-backend-java,alef-backend-swift,alef-backend-wasm,alef-backend-zig): migrate remaining backend doc-code emission and opaque-bridge interpolation from `push_str(&format!(...))` to dedicated Jinja templates (`javadoc_lines.jinja`, `doc_comment.jinja`, `rustdoc`, `param_opaque_config_from_json.jinja`).

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-zig): opaque C FFI handle types (`is_opaque = true` / `has_serde = false`, e.g. `CrawlEngineHandle`) are now excluded from `struct_names`. Previously they were treated as JSON-serializable structs and the generated wrappers called non-existent `_from_json`/`_to_json` C helpers. Functions taking an opaque handle now accept `?[]const u8` config JSON and internally call the creator function (discovered from the IR) to build, use, and free the handle per call.

- fix(alef-e2e/swift): `Optional<RustString>` fields now emit `({field_expr}?.toString() ?? "")` in Swift assertions instead of `{field_expr}.toString()`, fixing compile errors when the field is nullable. `not_empty`/`is_empty` assertions on array fields (`RustVec<T>`) now emit `{field_expr}.isEmpty` directly instead of routing through `.toString()` — `RustVec<T>` has no `.toString()`.

- fix(alef-e2e/zig): `handle` arg type in `build_args_and_setup` is now an explicit case: emits `null` when the fixture omits the engine config, or a JSON string literal when a config value is present. Aligns with the updated Zig binding that accepts `?[]const u8` for engine parameters.

- fix(alef-backend-zig): `error_doc_block.jinja` and `trait_method_doc_lines.jinja` now emit the trailing newline after the final doc-comment line. Under `trim_blocks = true`, `{%- endfor %}` was stripping the newline before the tag, merging the doc comment and the following `pub const` declaration onto one line — a Zig compile error.

- fix(alef-e2e/zig): `render_json_assertion` now resolves fixture field-path aliases through `FieldResolver` before building the JSON traversal chain. Previously, `content.detected_charset` was traversed as `result.object.get("content").?.object.get("detected_charset")` instead of the correct `result.object.get("detected_charset")`, causing runtime panics on fields that only exist at the top level.

## [0.15.35] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- feat(alef-backend-pyo3): `capsule_types` in `[crates.python]` is now wired into codegen. Types listed there are emitted as PyCapsule pass-through (via `PyCapsule_New` / `PyCapsule_GetPointer`) instead of opaque `#[pyclass]` wrappers. Supports two TOML forms: a bare string (`Language = "tree_sitter.Language"`) for capsule round-trips, and a struct (`Parser = { python_type = "tree_sitter.Parser", construct_from = "Language" }`) for Python-side construction (e.g. `tree_sitter.Parser(language)`).

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-dart): `flutter_rust_bridge.yaml` now pins `rust_input: crate` so FRB scans every top-level `pub fn` in the binding crate. Previously the key was omitted (under the assumption FRB 2.x had dropped it) and FRB defaulted to a narrower scope, silently skipping plugin lifecycle helpers (`unregister_*`, `register_document_extractor`, `register_renderer`, etc.) and leaving the generated wrapper referencing undefined bridge functions.

- fix(alef-backend-java): per-extractor Java wrappers (e.g. `HwpxExtractor.java`) now emit `import java.util.{List, Optional, Map}` when the trait's instance methods reference those types. Previously the import set was hard-coded to MemorySegment/Arena/ValueLayout/ObjectMapper, so `List<String> supportedMimeTypes()` failed javac with `cannot find symbol: class List`.

- fix(alef-core): `PythonConfig.capsule_types` schema is now `HashMap<String, CapsuleTypeConfig>` (was `HashMap<String, String>`). Existing `alef.toml` files using bare string values (e.g. `Language = "tree_sitter.Language"`) continue to deserialize correctly via `#[serde(untagged)]`.

### Changed

- refactor(alef-backend-zig,alef-backend-gleam,alef-backend-extendr): migrate additional interpolated `push_str`/`writeln!` emission paths to Jinja templates for trait bridge docs, error docs, import line emission, and visitor bridge assembly.
- refactor(alef-backend-csharp): replace inline `push_str`/`writeln!` visitor record emission for generated `NodeContext.cs` and `VisitResult.cs` with Jinja templates (`node_context.jinja`, `visit_result.jinja`).
- refactor(alef-backend-go): migrate additional `gen_visitor.rs` emission from inline `push_str` blocks to Jinja templates for visitor interface/registry/helper/trampoline/control-flow; generated `ConvertWithVisitor` now routes through `convertWithVisitorHelper` for shared logic.
- refactor(alef-backend-ffi): continue migrating parameterized trait-bridge code generation to Jinja templates for vtable error messages and async registration body lines (`ffi_vtable_not_initialised_msg.jinja`, `ffi_nul_byte_*_param_msg.jinja`, `ffi_vtable_null_out_result_msg.jinja`, plus async cached-name/clone/`map_err` templates).
- refactor(alef-backend-magnus): move more trait-bridge generation into Jinja templates (`trait_bridge_async_method_body.rs.jinja`, `trait_bridge_constructor.rs.jinja`, `trait_bridge_registration_fn.rs.jinja`, `trait_bridge_return_conversion.rs.jinja`), keeping behavior unchanged.

### Fixed

- fix(alef-e2e/gleam): `render_assertion` now resolves field aliases before calling `is_optional`, fixing incorrect non-optional treatment of fields accessed via fixture path aliases (e.g. `og.title` → `metadata.og_title`). Import pre-pass also uses resolved paths for optional detection.
- fix(alef-e2e/gleam): `not_empty` and `is_empty` assertions on non-array, non-optional String fields now emit `string.is_empty` instead of `list.is_empty`. Import pre-pass updated accordingly.
- fix(alef-e2e/gleam): Array element field assertions using indexed access (`[0].` and `[].`) are now both skipped with a comment, not just `[].` paths.
- fix(alef-backend-zig): Async Rust functions are no longer silently skipped in Zig binding generation. The C FFI exports synchronous wrappers for all functions (including those async in Rust), so Zig can call them directly.
- fix(alef-e2e/gleam): `render_assertion` now also resolves field aliases before setting `field_is_optional`, fixing optional wrapping for aliased fields at the render stage.
- fix(alef-e2e/gleam): `not_empty`/`is_empty` assertions on non-array, non-optional fields now emit `string.is_empty` instead of `list.is_empty` in `render_assertion`.
- fix(alef-e2e/gleam): Indexed array element fields (`[0].`) are now skipped alongside `[].` paths in `render_assertion`.
- fix(alef-e2e/gleam): Fields with a `.length` segment (e.g. `links.length`) now import `gleam/list` in the test file header.

## [0.15.34] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- refactor(alef-backend-zig,alef-backend-dart,alef-backend-php): move remaining generated-code emission blocks for Zig parameter/return handling, Dart trait bridge defaults, and PHP vector binding conversion into Jinja templates.
- refactor(alef-scaffold,alef-docs,alef-readme): render generated pre-commit YAML, scaffold Cargo env rows, API Markdown blocks, and README performance rows through Jinja templates.
- refactor(alef-backend-napi,alef-backend-extendr): move additional trait bridge wrappers, function bodies, serde bindings, and async parameter clone fragments into Jinja templates.

### Fixed

- fix(alef-e2e/kotlin): generate `MockServerListener.kt` and `META-INF/services/org.junit.platform.launcher.LauncherSessionListener` when any fixture needs the mock-server. Add `junit-platform-launcher` to `build.gradle.kts` when the listener is emitted. Previously `MOCK_SERVER_URL` was never set, causing all mock-server-dependent Kotlin e2e tests to fail.

- fix(alef-e2e/kotlin): generate Kotlin-native collection access and nullable assertion expressions for optional fields, arrays, maps, and JNA library path setup.

- fix(alef-e2e/zig): replace `std.posix.getenv` with `std.process.getenv` in generated test preambles. `std.posix.getenv` was removed in Zig 0.16.0; `std.process.getenv` is the correct API and works across all supported Zig versions.

- fix(alef-e2e/gleam): `build_args_and_setup` now handles `handle` and `mock_url` argument types. `handle` args emit `let assert Ok(<name>) = module.create_<name>(option.None)` setup and `option` is added to imports. `mock_url` args emit an `envoy.get("MOCK_SERVER_URL")` URL construction and `envoy` is imported via `gleam_envoy`. Previously both fell through to the catch-all, producing a single-argument JSON call instead of the correct multi-argument form.

- fix(alef-e2e): `field_access.rs` now emits `list.length` for `PathSegment::Length` in Gleam (was missing), and handles nested map/array access chains correctly across all e2e codegen backends.

- fix(alef-backend-swift): Duration-typed struct fields now bridge correctly through swift-bridge. Constructors emit `std::time::Duration::from_millis(<param>)` (or `.map(std::time::Duration::from_millis)` for optional), and getters emit `self.0.<field>.as_millis() as u64` (or `.map(|d| d.as_millis() as u64)` for optional). Previously both fell through to the generic field assign template, causing `E0308 expected Duration, found u64` in every swift binding crate that has timeout fields.

## [0.15.33] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- refactor(alef-backend-swift): move remaining Swift backend generated-code blocks for inbound plugin bridges, JSON factory shims, and Swift convenience overloads from inline string assembly into Jinja templates.

- refactor(alef-backend-magnus,alef-backend-php,alef-backend-rustler): move more generated function-body, registration, serde-binding, and enum-conversion emission from inline `format!` assembly into Jinja templates while preserving generated output behavior.

- refactor(alef-backend-csharp,alef-backend-dart,alef-backend-ffi,alef-backend-java,alef-codegen): move additional generated-code emission blocks from inline `push_str`/`format!` assembly into Jinja templates while preserving the existing generated output contracts.

### Added

- feat(alef-e2e/rust): the C# and Java e2e codegen now calls `resolve_call_for_fixture` (which honours `select_when = { input_has = "..." }` in `[crates.e2e.calls.*]`) instead of the no-input `resolve_call`. Fixtures with `input.batch_urls: []` (and no explicit `call` override) now route to `batch_scrape()` / `BatchScrape()` instead of the default `scrape()`. Go and Python codegen already used the correct resolver; C# (`csharp.rs:775, 3032`) and Java (`java.rs:458, 498, 961`) were the only callers of the wrong variant.

- feat(alef-e2e/rust): the Rust e2e codegen now emits a `tests/common.rs` module whenever the fixture suite requires a standalone mock server. The module exposes `pub fn mock_server_url() -> &'static str` backed by `std::sync::OnceLock`, spawning `target/release/mock-server` with the fixtures directory on first call, parsing its `MOCK_SERVER_URL=<url>` and `MOCK_SERVERS={...json...}` stdout lines, and setting `std::env::set_var` for each. Generated test files that previously panicked with `MOCK_SERVER_URL not set` now import `mod common;` and call `common::mock_server_url()`. Mirrors Python (`conftest.py`), Node (`globalSetup.ts`), and Elixir (`test_helper.exs`) session-level orchestration.

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-java): extract the repeated bytes-FFI result block (rc check, outPtr read, free, return) from `stream_method_bytes_result.jinja` into a `readBytesResult` helper method emitted once per class by `streaming_helpers.jinja`. Eliminates the 17-line CPD duplication flagged when two or more byte-returning methods (e.g. `speech`, `fileContent`) are generated in the same class.

- fix(alef-backend-swift,alef-backend-napi,alef-codegen): harden remaining trait bridge generation edge cases. Swift trait bridge JSON envelopes now serialize success and error payloads with `serde_json`, Swift inbound wrappers handle `returns_ref` `Vec<String>` methods without overriding default trait methods, NAPI trait bridge parse errors include plugin context, and excluded type paths no longer overwrite visible binding type paths with the same short name.

- fix(alef-backend-dart): the core→mirror `From` impl for struct fields of type `Duration` now emits `v.{name}.as_millis() as i64` (or `.map(|d| d.as_millis() as i64)` for optional) instead of the invalid `v.{name} as _`. `Duration` is not a primitive type and cannot be coerced with `as`; the previous codegen produced `E0605 non-primitive cast: Duration as i64` for any crate that has `Duration`-typed fields (e.g. `BrowserConfig.timeout`, `CrawlConfig.request_timeout`).

- fix(alef-e2e/ruby): fixtures with only a `not_error` assertion now emit a real test body (`expect { }.not_to raise_error`) instead of `skip "Non-HTTP fixture cannot be tested via Net::HTTP"`.

- fix(alef-codegen,alef-backend-php): `gen_lossy_binding_to_core_fields_inner` and `gen_php_lossy_binding_to_core_fields` now skip fields whose `field.cfg` is `Some(...)`. Previously, cfg-gated fields (e.g. `pdf_options`, `keywords`, `layout`) were emitted in the binding→core struct literal even though those fields are absent from the binding struct (they are filled by `..Default::default()`). The generated code produced `E0609 "no field X on type &ExtractionConfig"` in downstream PyO3 and PHP crates after alef regen.

- fix(alef-backend-napi): three related NAPI codegen correctness fixes: (1) `gen_struct` now filters cfg-gated fields when emitting the binding struct definition and its manual `Clone` impl, preventing `E0063 "missing fields in initializer"` for structs like `JsExtractionConfig`; (2) `sync_method_non_unit_return.jinja` and `async_method_non_unit_return.jinja` now return `Err({{ error_parse }})` instead of `Ok(Default::default())` for null/empty JSON in error-returning methods, avoiding `E0277` caused by `InternalDocument` not implementing `Default`; (3) `field_conversion_from_core` and `field_conversion_to_core` now handle `Map(_, Bytes)` explicitly — `HashMap<String, Vec<u8>>` core fields (e.g. `tessdata_bytes`) are correctly round-tripped through `HashMap<String, Buffer>` in the NAPI binding using `.to_vec().into()`.

- fix(alef-backend-swift): `emit_extern_block_for_trait_bridge` and `emit_trait_bridge_wrapper` no longer emit `Result<T, String>` return types for error-returning trait bridge methods. swift-bridge 0.1.59 panics with "Type must be declared with `type >`" when it encounters `Result<T, E>` inside an `extern "Rust"` block. Error-returning methods now use a plain `String` return carrying a JSON envelope (`{"ok": <value>}` / `{"err": "<message>"}`) so swift-bridge can parse the extern block. The Rust trampoline body serialises the `Result` to this envelope; the Swift caller deserialises it.

- fix(alef-e2e/rust): `needs_mock_server` in the Rust e2e codegen (`rust/mod.rs`) and the per-file `file_needs_mock` condition in `test_file.rs` were gated on `f.mock_response.is_some()` — the legacy liter-llm single-response shape. Fixtures using the array form (`input.mock_responses: [...]`, the kreuzcrawl shape) returned `false` for that check, so the entire kreuzcrawl suite had `needs_mock_server = false`. Consequently: (1) `tests/common.rs` was never generated (gated on `needs_mock_server`), (2) `mod common;` was never emitted in test files. Test files called `common::mock_server_url()` without the module declaration, causing `E0433 cannot find module or crate 'common'` and a compilation failure. Fix: use `f.needs_mock_server()` (which already handles all three shapes: liter-llm, http, and kreuzcrawl array form) in both detection sites.

- fix(alef-backend-java): the compact-constructor emission in `gen_record_type` no longer coerces an explicit `0` to the Rust-default value for `Duration`-typed (boxed Long) fields. Previously the generated Java record contained `if (requestTimeout == null || requestTimeout == 0) requestTimeout = 30000L;` — callers who intentionally passed `request_timeout: 0` (which the Rust core rejects via `validate()` as invalid) had their value silently replaced with the default before the FFI boundary, so the validation error was never surfaced. The fix drops `|| requestTimeout == 0`; only absent JSON fields (Jackson deserialises boxed numerics as `null` when the key is missing) still receive the default.

- fix(alef-e2e/dart): `json_object` args that contain a plain JSON array (e.g. `batch_urls: ["/p1", "/p2"]`) now emit `final {name} = (jsonDecode(r'...') as List<dynamic>).cast<String>();` + pass the variable to the call, instead of silently dropping the argument. Previously any `json_object` without an explicit `element_type` of `BatchBytesItem`/`BatchFileItem` and without the name `config` was skipped entirely.

- fix(alef-e2e/dart): the Dart e2e codegen now correctly handles `handle` and `mock_url` arg types. Previously both arg types fell through to the `_ => {}` catch-all, so generated tests had no arguments and called the wrong `KreuzbergBridge` class (a kreuzberg-specific hardcode). Fixes: (1) `handle` args emit engine construction — `CrawlConfig.fromJson(jsonDecode(...))` then `await {BridgeClass}.createEngine(config)` — before the main call; (2) `mock_url` args emit `Platform.environment["MOCK_SERVER_URL"]` URL construction; (3) the receiver class now derives from `[dart] lib_name` (converted to PascalCase + "Bridge") via a new `dart_bridge_class_name()` method on `ResolvedCrateConfig` instead of the hardcoded `"KreuzbergBridge"` literal; (4) error-expecting fixtures with setup lines wrap the full setup + call in an `async` lambda so any exception at any step is caught by `throwsA(anything)`; (5) `import 'dart:convert'` is now emitted when any non-HTTP fixture uses a `handle` arg (previously only emitted for HTTP fixtures).

- fix(alef-e2e/zig): the `mock_url` arg type in the Zig e2e codegen now emits `const {name} = try std.fmt.allocPrint(allocator, ...)` + `defer allocator.free({name})` instead of the previously invalid `var {} = try allocator.alloc(u8, std.fmt.bufPrint(undefined, ...) catch 0)`. The old pattern produced a Zig syntax error (`expected ';' after statement`) and an incorrect allocation size. The new pattern uses `std.fmt.allocPrint` which allocates exactly the right number of bytes for the formatted URL string.

- fix(alef-backend-dart): Vec<Json> (e.g. `MarkdownResult.tables: Vec<serde_json::Value>`) fields in core→mirror `From` impls now emit `.map(|j| serde_json::to_string(&j).unwrap_or_default())` instead of falling through to the identity return (`v.{name}`). Previously, `TypeRef::Json` inside a `Vec` was treated as a pass-through, producing `E0308 mismatched types: expected Vec<String>, found Vec<Value>`.

- fix(alef-backend-swift): `Duration`-typed struct fields now emit correct constructor and getter code. The constructor body emits `__target.{name} = std::time::Duration::from_millis({param});` (or `.map(std::time::Duration::from_millis)` for optional) via two new Jinja templates (`default_field_duration_assign.jinja`, `default_field_optional_duration_assign.jinja`). Getters emit `self.0.{name}.as_millis() as u64` (or `.map(|d| d.as_millis() as u64)` for optional) via `getter_duration.jinja` and `getter_optional_duration.jinja`. Previously both paths fell through to generic templates that emitted `__target.timeout = timeout` / `self.0.timeout.clone()`, producing `E0308 mismatched types` for any struct with a `Duration` field (e.g. `BrowserConfig.timeout`, `CrawlConfig.request_timeout`).

- fix(alef-backend-dart): opaque handle types (e.g. `CrawlEngineHandle`) now emit a `#[frb(opaque)] pub struct {Name} { pub(crate) inner: source::{Name} }` wrapper instead of `#[frb(mirror({Name}))] pub struct {Name} {}` (an empty zero-sized struct). The empty mirror pattern caused `E0308` for return values (`CrawlEngineHandle::from(v)` with no `From` impl) and would have silently destroyed the engine value via an unsound zero-sized transmute. Bridge functions now use `&engine.inner` (input) and `|inner| Name { inner }` (return) instead of transmute/From.

- fix(alef-backend-dart): struct types that contain `Duration` or `Path` fields are now included in `types_needing_from_conversion` (and transitively in `types_needing_from_impl`), causing them to use `{core_ty}::from(mirror_val)` at call sites instead of `unsafe { transmute }`. Previously, `Duration` fields (16-byte `std::time::Duration` in core vs 8-byte `i64` in mirror) and `Path` fields were not considered sanitized by the IR, so structs like `CrawlConfig` used a transmute that caused `E0512 cannot transmute between types of different sizes` (6720-bit mirror vs 6848-bit core).

- fix(alef-codegen): `gen_bridge_trait_impl` now wraps `Vec<String>` bodies in a `Box::leak` pattern when the trait method signature declares `returns_ref = true` (i.e. `&[&str]`). Previously, `supported_mime_types()` bridge bodies returned `Vec<String>` but the trait requires `&[&str]`, causing `E0308` in generated Python, Node.js, PHP, and Swift binding crates after `alef generate`.

- fix(alef-backend-swift): two additional Swift trait bridge fixes: (1) `emit_trait_method_body` generated `format!("{\"ok\": ...}")` which is invalid Rust format syntax because `{` must start a format spec, not a literal; doubled the outer braces so the generated code emits literal `{` and `}` characters correctly. (2) `emit_extern_block_for_trait_bridge` and `emit_trait_bridge_wrapper` now skip methods with `has_default_impl = true` (e.g. `as_sync_extractor` returning `Option<&dyn SyncExtractor>`) — these cannot be expressed in swift-bridge and rely on the trait's own default impl.

- fix(alef-backend-php): `gen_struct_methods_impl` now filters cfg-gated fields (`field.cfg.is_some()`) when building constructor parameter lists, `let_binding` loops, and `param_init` struct literals. `gen_enum_tainted_from_binding_to_core` also skips cfg-gated fields in its field loop. Previously, cfg-gated fields like `pdf_options` were emitted as constructor parameters and in `From` impls even though they are absent from the PHP binding struct, producing `E0560 "struct has no field named pdf_options"`.

- fix(alef-backend-napi): `gen_struct` now maps `Bytes` fields to `Vec<u8>` in struct field position via a `map_bytes_field_type` closure instead of `mapper.map_type`. `napi::bindgen_prelude::Buffer` does not implement `Clone`, `Serialize`, or `Deserialize`, causing derive failures on structs with bytes fields (e.g. `JsOcrConfig`). `Buffer` is still used for function parameters. The `has_bytes_field` manual-`Clone` workaround is removed since `Vec<u8>` is `Clone`.

- fix(alef-e2e): Java mock server URL lookup now checks `System.getProperty("mockServerUrl", ...)` with env fallback so the URL can be injected via JVM system property. Ruby client factory calls switched from keyword args (`api_key: ..., base_url: ...`) to positional args to match the actual generated factory method signatures.

- fix(alef-e2e/rust): the generated `common.rs` `BufReader` now takes ownership of `ChildStdout` (`BufReader::new(stdout)`) instead of borrowing it (`BufReader::new(&mut stdout)`). The previous pattern caused `E0597` on Rust 2024: the drain thread (`std::thread::spawn(move || reader.into_inner())`) requires `'static` bounds, but a `BufReader<&mut ChildStdout>` wraps a local reference that is not `'static`. Owned `BufReader<ChildStdout>` satisfies the bound.

- fix(alef-backend-magnus): streaming adapter (`gen_iterator_struct`) now derives the core-crate prefix from the configured `core_import_name` rather than the hardcoded literal `liter_llm::`. The `StreamingAdapter` struct gains a `core_crate` field populated from `core_import` (computed at the top of `generate_bindings`) and threaded through `from_config`. Fixes the no-special-casing rule: any downstream crate (not only liter-llm) that wires a `streaming` adapter now gets `{core_crate}::{ItemType}` / `{core_crate}::{ErrorType}` in the emitted iterator struct instead of a crate-name assumption.

- fix(alef-e2e/wasm): the emitted `vitest.config.ts` now sets `testTimeout: 30000` globally for the WASM e2e suite. Vitest's default 5 s deadline is too tight for fixtures that exercise liter-llm's retry path (504 / 429 / 500 / 502 are retryable with backoff); those tests all timed out at the default, masking real pass/fail outcomes. A 30 s timeout matches the rest of the suite's retry window.

### Added

- feat(alef-backend-ffi): emit `{prefix}_{enum}_to_string(*const Enum) -> *mut c_char` for unit-variant enums (`has_serde = true`) that are returned as heap-allocated pointers. The function uses `serde_json::to_value(val).as_str()` to extract the bare variant name (e.g. `"completed"`) without surrounding JSON quotes, so C/Zig/Dart e2e callers can string-compare an enum field accessor against a fixture string without reaching for `_to_json` (which yields a JSON-quoted form). Sibling helper to existing `_to_json`/`_free`; emitted only when the enum is in `enum_pointer_return` AND `can_generate_enum_conversion` (gates out compound enums whose serde shape is not a plain string).

### Fixed

- fix(alef-e2e/c): when a fixture assertion targets a field that is registered in `[crates.e2e] fields_enum` AND the field's resolved type in `[crates.e2e] fields_c_types` is a non-primitive PascalCase enum name (e.g. `BatchStatus`), emit an opaque-handle declaration plus a `{prefix}_{enum_snake}_to_string({handle})` conversion call rather than declaring the accessor return as `char*`. The previous output (`char* status = literllm_batch_object_status(result); assert(str_trim_eq(status, "completed") == 0);`) treated the FFI's `LITERLLMBatchStatus*` opaque pointer as a C string, causing immediate `Abort trap: 6` / NULL-deref in every C e2e fixture that compared an enum field. Applied to all four accessor sites: `render_test_function` (default-client and legacy paths), `render_engine_factory_test_function`, and the leaf branch of `emit_nested_accessor`. Cleanup: the opaque handle is registered in `intermediate_handles` so the existing reverse-order free loop calls `{prefix}_{enum_snake}_free(...)`; the `to_string` result is a heap `char*` freed by `{prefix}_free_string` like any other accessor result.

- fix(alef-backend-ffi): `_free`/`_to_json`/`_to_string` are now also emitted for enum types that are returned by *struct field accessors* (not just by free functions or method returns). Previously the `enum_pointer_return` set was built from `api.functions` and `typ.methods` only — fields like `BatchObject.status: BatchStatus` produced an opaque-pointer accessor (`literllm_batch_object_status`) without a matching `_free` / `_to_string`, leaking memory and forcing C callers to treat the return as an unfreeable handle. The detection now walks `typ.fields` too. The pre-existing comment ("Also check struct field accessors and method returns…") matched the intent but the code was missing the field-walk half.

- fix(alef-e2e/c): the iter11 sentinel fix `(uint64_t)-1, (uint32_t)-1` for `*_create_client` only landed in `render_chat_stream_test_function`. The default-client path in `render_test_function` and the bytes-result path in `render_bytes_test_function` still emitted literal `0, 0` — passing them as `Some(0)` to the FFI yielded `Duration::from_secs(0)` and aborted every non-streaming HTTP fixture. Both call sites now also emit the sentinel. Mirror of 0.15.28 java/csharp marshalling fix.

- fix(alef-e2e/c): `emit_nested_accessor` now correctly handles `field[N]` numeric array indexing in chained paths (e.g. `data[0].index`, `choices[0].message.tool_calls[0].function.name`). Previously the bracket branch returned early after emitting `alef_json_get_string(parent, "0")` — looking up literal key `"0":` instead of the Nth array element — so any path with array indexing returned NULL and aborted on the first downstream assertion. New runtime helper `alef_json_array_get_index(json, idx)` extracts the Nth top-level element of a JSON array; the codegen emits it whenever it sees a numeric bracket key (both at top-level and inside `json_extract_mode`). Bare `[]` still uses substring search semantics. Required for fixtures with multi-element result arrays where each element's fields are asserted independently (e.g. `data[0].index == 0`, `data[1].index == 1`).

- fix(alef-e2e/c): `alef_json_get_string` now falls through to `alef_json_get_object` when the value at the resolved key is a JSON object/array, and returns the raw token string when the value is a primitive (number / bool / null). Previously it strictly required string values, so leaf accessors over collection-typed fields (`Vec<T>`, `Option<Vec<T>>`) and numeric leaves accessed via `json_extract_mode` (e.g. `data[0].index` of type `u32`) returned NULL and broke `not_empty` / `count_equals` / `equals` assertions. Adds a runtime helper `alef_json_get_object` that uses balanced-bracket matching to extract `{...}` / `[...]` substrings; codegen also uses it directly for intermediate object hops in `json_extract_mode`.

- fix(alef-e2e/c): "expected error" fixtures (assertion type `error`) now treat a NULL return from `*_request_from_json` as the expected failure path instead of asserting non-null. Mirrors Java's `assertThrows(Exception.class, () -> { … })` and Python's `pytest.raises(...)` patterns: when the fixture's input contains an invalid enum value (e.g. `"purpose":"invalid-purpose"` for `FilePurpose`), serde's strict deserialization rejects it before the request leaves the binding, and that counts as the expected error. Without this, every C error fixture whose error originates in the input layer crashed at the build step rather than reaching its `assert(result == NULL)` final assertion.

- fix(alef-e2e/c): smoke/live fixtures gated on a required env var (`fixture.env.api_key_var`, e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`) now emit a `if (getenv(VAR) == NULL) return;` short-circuit at the top of the test body. Previously the C suite hard-failed on any missing-credentials run; now CI without provider creds gracefully skips these tests, matching Python's `pytest.skip(...)` and Java's `Assumptions.assumeTrue(...)`.

- fix(alef-e2e/c): streaming tool_calls assertions (`tool_calls`, `tool_calls[0].function.name`) are now emitted as skip comments instead of attempting to parse them out of the last SSE chunk's `choices`. The OpenAI streaming wire format distributes a single tool call's fields across many delta chunks, and the inline C SSE parser only inspects the last chunk — which carries `finish_reason=tool_calls` but no payload — so the assertions could never evaluate. Mirrors Python's `# skipped: field 'tool_calls' not available on result type` for the same fixture. A delta-merge accumulator is the proper long-term fix; tracked separately.

- fix(alef-e2e/wasm): generate `globalSetup.ts` (which spawns the mock-server and exports `MOCK_SERVER_URL`) for any fixture that needs the mock server, not just `is_http_test()` (which only matched the consumer-style `http: { ... }` shape and missed the entire `mock_response: { ... }` set used by liter-llm). Without globalSetup, every fixture that interpolates `${process.env.MOCK_SERVER_URL}/fixtures/<id>` into a base URL hit `undefined/fixtures/<id>` and `reqwest::Client::builder().build()` resolved to `Err(builder error)` because the URL parser rejected the constructed `Url`. Predicate now uses `Fixture::needs_mock_server()` which covers both schemas; the surrounding comment block already stated the same intent. Lifts liter-llm WASM e2e from 56/161 → 153/161 passing in a single config change.

- fix(alef-backend-java): revert kreuzcrawl-specific `dispatchCrawlError` typed-exception dispatch in the FFI `checkLastError` helper. Commit `44507046` had hardcoded references to `TimeoutException`, `ConnectionException`, `GoneException`, `BadGatewayException`, `BrowserTimeoutException`, `CrawlErrorException` etc. — exception classes that exist in kreuzcrawl but not in any other downstream — into the shared template. Regenerating the Java binding for liter-llm (or any downstream other than kreuzcrawl) produced a `LiterLlmRs.java` referencing undefined symbols and broke `mvn package`. The case-2 branch is now back to the pre-44507046 emission `throw new ConversionErrorException(msg)`. The proper fix — config-driven typed-exception dispatch keyed by error-code mapping — is tracked under iter15's "remove downstream-crate special-casing" plan; kreuzcrawl can re-add its dispatcher via that mechanism (or via a post-process step in its own toolchain) without polluting the shared backend.

## [0.15.30] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-ffi): async trait method bodies with `&str` params now capture via `.to_string()` instead of `.clone()`. `.clone()` on `&str` returns `&str` — the borrow escaped into the `spawn_blocking` closure, causing E0521 ("borrowed data escapes outside of method"). The fix is in `gen_async_method_body` in `registration.rs`: `TypeRef::String | TypeRef::Char` with `is_ref=true` now emit `let x = x.to_string()` before the closure.
- fix(alef-backend-ffi): async trait method bodies whose trait return type is an excluded Named type (present in `api.excluded_type_paths`, e.g. `InternalDocument`) now correctly emit `serde_json::from_str::<QualifiedPath>(&json)` in the closure body and `Result<QualifiedPath, _>` in the method signature. Previously a stale IR cache (written before the `sanitize_unknown_types` trait-method exemption was added) rewrote `Named("InternalDocument")` to `TypeRef::String`, causing the codegen to emit `Ok(cs.to_string_lossy().into_owned())` — a `String` where the trait expected `InternalDocument`. The root fix was `alef generate --clean` which invalidates the stale cache; the code generator itself was already correct (verified by new regression test `bug6_async_excluded_type_return_signature_and_deserialization`).

- fix(alef-e2e/rust mock-server): emit `MOCK_SERVERS={...}` (possibly `{}`) unconditionally as a sentinel line so parent-process parsers — Python's conftest, Ruby's spec_helper, etc. — that read until they observe MOCK_SERVERS never block on a `readline()` that the server was never going to emit. Previously the line was only printed when `fixture_urls` was non-empty (host-root fixtures present), and downstreams without any host-root fixtures (liter-llm) timed out their entire e2e suites at conftest setup. The empty `{}` is parsed as a no-op JSON object so no per-fixture env vars get set.
- fix(alef-e2e/ruby): assertion codegen now consults the per-call `[crates.e2e.calls.<x>.overrides.ruby] enum_fields = { ... }` override (in addition to the global `[crates.e2e] fields_enum`) when deciding whether to coerce the Ruby field expression via `.to_s` for `equals` comparisons. Magnus binds Rust enums as Ruby Symbols, so an assertion `expect(result.status).to eq("completed")` fails against a returned `:completed` Symbol — the per-call override is already populated for the C#/Java/Python sides; threading the same map into the Ruby render preserves the single-source-of-truth contract instead of forcing a Ruby-only duplicate of every enum field.
- fix(alef-e2e/elixir): same per-call enum_fields lookup as ruby — Rustler binds Rust enums as Elixir atoms (`:in_progress`), so `String.trim(result.status)` raises `FunctionClauseError`. Threading the per-call map alongside the global `fields_enum` set lets the existing `to_string/1` coercion fire when the operator labels e.g. `status = "BatchStatus"` for the elixir side.
- fix(alef-e2e/elixir): emit the `{:ok, client} = create_client(...)` setup line inside the expects_error branch as well. The non-error path emits this client binding then references `client` in the call expression; the expects_error path was missing the binding, so generated test bodies failed compilation with `undefined variable "client"` for every error_handling fixture.
- fix(alef-e2e/c): pass the FFI's `None` sentinel (`(uint64_t)-1` / `(uint32_t)-1`) — not literal `0` — for the `timeout_secs` and `max_retries` parameters of the generated `*_create_client(...)` invocation, mirroring the alef-backend-{java,csharp} marshalling fix from 0.15.28. Passing `0` made the FFI shim resolve to `Some(Duration::from_secs(0))`, wiring an immediate-deadline reqwest client that aborted every HTTP fixture in the C suite. Adds `<stdint.h>` to the test-file header block so the cast types resolve.

## [0.15.29] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-ffi): sync trait method bodies emitting static error messages now coerce bare string literals to `String` via `.to_string()`. Previously, `gen_vtable_call_body(inside_closure=false)` passed the literal directly to `spec.make_error(...)`, producing e.g. `KreuzbergError::Other("nul byte in serialized param doc")` — a `&'static str` — which fails E0308 when the error variant wraps `String`. The fix is in the `make_err` closure in `call_body.rs`: when not inside the async `_SendFn` closure and the message is a quoted string literal, `.to_string()` is appended before passing to `make_error`. The async closure path (`Box::from(...)`) is unaffected.

## [0.15.28]

### Fixed

- fix(alef-backend-java,alef-backend-csharp): pass the FFI `None` sentinel (`{prim}::MAX`, `NaN`) — not zero — when an `Optional<numeric_primitive>` parameter is null. The FFI binding generated by `alef-backend-ffi` decodes `if x == {prim}::MAX { None }` to recover the absent case; the Java/C# marshallers were instead coercing `null` to `0`/`0L`/`0.0`, so a caller passing `null` ended up handing the host crate `Some(0)` — silently colliding with legitimate zero values (e.g. `timeout_secs=Some(0)` was treated as "no timeout" but instead produced an immediate-deadline reqwest client, breaking ~30 e2e tests per language in liter-llm with "error sending request"). Sentinel choice mirrors `alef-backend-ffi/src/gen_bindings/functions.rs::param_optional_numeric_conversion`: unsigned ints use bitwise `-1` (all-bits-set = `u{N}::MAX`), signed ints use the boxed type's `MAX_VALUE`, floats use `NaN`. Bool optionals retain the existing fall-through (separate FFI path).
- fix(alef-e2e/c): align generated Makefile mock-server invocation with the rest of the suite — point `MOCK_SERVER_BIN` at `../rust/target/release/mock-server` (matches python conftest, php bootstrap, java MockServerListener) instead of `../../target/release/mock-server`, and pass the fixtures directory as a positional argument rather than `--fixtures …` (mock-server's CLI takes a single positional `[fixtures-dir]`, so the flag form was being parsed as the fixtures-dir literal — `loaded 0 routes from --fixtures`).
- fix(alef-e2e/typescript): `not_empty` assertion is now polymorphic — strings/arrays still use `length > 0`, but objects use `expect(_v).toBeDefined()` + `.not.toBeNull()`. The previous template assumed string-like fields and emitted `(field ?? "").length > 0`; for object-typed fields like Cohere's `JsRerankResultDocument` (a `{text: string}` wrapper, not a bare string) `({text: "…"} ?? "").length` evaluates to `undefined`, and Vitest reports "actual value must be number or bigint, received undefined". The runtime branch on `typeof === "string"` / `Array.isArray()` keeps the existing string-and-array semantics intact for all current fixtures while extending to object payloads.

## [0.15.26] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- feat(alef-backend-gleam): emit `unregister_fn` and `clear_fn` external Gleam declarations from `TraitBridgeConfig` when the fields are set; short-circuits to no output when `None`. Closes the gap where Gleam silently ignored the optional unregister/clear lifecycle config that other backends already honored.
- feat(alef-backend-go): emit `unregister_fn` and `clear_fn` Go wrappers from `TraitBridgeConfig` when set; short-circuits empty when `None`. Generated wrappers delegate to the host crate's C-exported `kreuzberg_unregister_*(name, &err)` and `kreuzberg_clear_*(&err)` symbols via cgo.
- feat(alef-backend-csharp): replace hardcoded `Unregister{Trait}` P/Invoke generation with config-driven lookup of `bridge_config.unregister_fn`. Previously every C# trait-bridge always emitted an `Unregister*` declaration regardless of host capability; now the declaration and the static `Unregister(name)` C# method are conditional on the config field being set, matching the contract every other backend already honored.
- feat(alef-backend-java): emit `unregister_fn` and `clear_fn` Panama FFM downcall handles + Java methods from `TraitBridgeConfig` when set. Each emits a `Method.invoke(...)` over the configured C symbol with the `FunctionDescriptor.of(JAVA_INT, ADDRESS)` shape and drains the local Java-side bridge map on clear.
- feat(alef-backend-dart): emit Dart-side `unregisterXxx(name)` and `clearXxxs()` static methods on the generated bridge class when `unregister_fn` / `clear_fn` are set, plus a Rust-side `clear_*` forwarder for FRB to bridge. Previously the Rust-side unregister forwarder existed but the Dart caller had no way to invoke clear (clear was emitted in Rust but never surfaced to Dart).
- feat(alef-backend-zig): emit `unregister_fn` and `clear_fn` Zig wrappers from `TraitBridgeConfig` when set. Generated wrappers are thin `extern "C"` passthroughs over the host crate's exported `kreuzberg_unregister_*(name, out_error)` and `kreuzberg_clear_*(out_error)` symbols, returning Zig `i32` return codes.
- feat(alef-backend-swift): emit `unregister_fn` and `clear_fn` swift-bridge `extern "Rust"` declarations + `pub fn` bodies from `TraitBridgeConfig` when set. Generated bodies access the registry directly via `registry_getter()` + `guard.remove(name)` / `guard.clear()` and adapt errors to Swift-friendly `Result<(), String>`. Refactor extracts the trait-bridge codegen into a `SwiftBridgeGenerator: TraitBridgeGenerator` impl, keeping the wrapper-emission path consolidated with the other backends.
- feat(alef-backend-kotlin): introduce `KotlinJvmBridgeGenerator: TraitBridgeGenerator` impl emitting `unregisterXxx(name)` / `clearXxxs()` thin Kotlin wrappers that delegate to the JVM-side `XxxBridge.unregisterXxx` / `clearAllXxx` static methods. Methods short-circuit to nothing when the corresponding config field is `None`.
- feat(alef-backend-wasm): emit a synthetic `pub fn default()` static factory on every wasm-bindgen wrapper struct that derives `Default`. wasm-bindgen mirrors the Rust `(constructor)` arity, so structs with non-Optional fields (e.g. `WasmChatCompletionTool { tool_type, function }`) can only be instantiated with positional args from JS — `new WasmChatCompletionTool()` throws. The factory delegates to `<Self as ::core::default::Default>::default()` so JS callers can obtain a fresh instance and drive it via setters. Skipped automatically when the IR already exposes an explicit `default` method to avoid impl-block conflicts.

### Fixed

- fix(alef-cli): `sync-versions` now writes to root `package.json` and every `crates/*-node/package.json` — both manifests are already validated by `validate-versions`, but were silently absent from the sync writer, so polyrepos with a private pnpm-workspace root manifest (e.g. `kreuzberg-root`) had to bump their version manually before every release. Sync is idempotent and only top-level `"version"` is rewritten — nested dependency specs and `pnpm.overrides` are untouched.
- fix(alef-e2e/typescript): use `.default()` factory for all wasm class instantiations in test bodies, not just `*Config` types. The previous `new WasmFoo()` pattern only worked for structs whose fields were all `Option<T>`; structs with required fields (e.g. `WasmChatCompletionTool`, `WasmFunctionDefinition`, `WasmResponseTool`) caused ~9 e2e tests to fail with "expected instance of WasmFoo" or constructor-arity TypeError. Combined with the new synthetic `default()` factory, `_u = WasmFoo.default()` now works uniformly.
- fix(alef-e2e/python): error-assertion compares the fixture value against EITHER `str(exc_info.value)` OR `type(exc_info.value).__name__`. Different downstream crates use different fixture-shape conventions — kreuzcrawl fixture values are message substrings (`"max_depth"`, `"proxy"`), liter-llm fixture values are class-name prefixes (`"Authentication"`, `"BadRequest"`). The disjunction lets a single codegen path satisfy both without a config flag.
- fix(alef-e2e/csharp): streaming `lastFinishReason` accumulator now uses `JsonNamingPolicy.SnakeCaseLower.ConvertName(...)` instead of `.ToString().ToLower()`. The latter collapses compound PascalCase enum names like `ToolCalls` to `toolcalls` (no underscore), causing equality assertions against fixture wire-form values like `"tool_calls"` to fail. The new emission matches the policy used by the global `JsonStringEnumConverter` and the non-streaming assertion path at `csharp.rs:2087-2094`.
- refactor(alef-e2e): drop hardcoded downstream-crate names from dart/zig/r e2e codegen. dart now emits `import 'package:{pkg_name}/{pkg_name}.dart'` driven by the resolved `[e2e.packages.dart]` config; zig's `build.zig` resolves `pkg_name`, `module_name`, `ffi_lib_name`, and `ffi_crate_path` from config (mirroring the FFI helper pattern) instead of literal `kreuzberg`/`libkreuzberg_ffi`/`crates/kreuzberg-ffi`; the R `setup_fixtures.jinja` template and `r.rs` codegen renamed `.kreuzberg_test_documents` to the alef-internal generic `.alef_test_documents`. None of these change behavior for kreuzberg (defaults preserve existing names) but removes the assumption that the downstream crate is named "kreuzberg".
- feat(alef-core): introduce `[e2e] test_documents_dir` config knob (default `"test_documents"`) and a centralised `E2eConfig::test_documents_relative_from(emission_depth)` helper that computes the relative path from a backend's emission directory to the configured fixture-binary directory. Replaces hardcoded `"../../test_documents"` / `"../../../test_documents"` literals across all 10 backends (dart, ruby, zig, r, gleam, elixir, go, php, csharp, swift, wasm, typescript, java pom, python conftest, rust args) with calls into the helper. Defaults preserve kreuzberg's behaviour; downstreams whose fixtures don't reference files (liter-llm) can leave the default in place — backends already emit the chdir/setup hook conditionally on `has_file_fixtures`. Hand-rolled `Default` impl on `E2eConfig` ensures the field receives `"test_documents"` even when constructed via `..Default::default()` rather than serde-deserialised.
- fix(alef-backend-ffi): use `config.core_import` (already plumbed into the FFI param-conversion path) as the type-name prefix in `type_ref_to_rust_type` instead of hardcoding `"kreuzberg::"`. The prefix governs how named struct/enum types from the consumer crate are referenced in the generated FFI shim; baking the literal name in meant any non-kreuzberg downstream produced unresolved type paths in the emitted Rust.
- refactor(alef-e2e/gleam): drop kreuzberg-specific Gleam codegen helpers. The OTP-application-startup shim now binds the configured `pkg_name` (snake-cased crate name from `[e2e.packages.gleam] name`) so `application:ensure_all_started/1` adapts to the downstream binding; the helper function name is now `start_app/0` (was `start_kreuzberg/0`) — a fixed, downstream-agnostic identifier. The `BatchFileItem`/`BatchBytesItem` `element_type` branches in `build_args_and_setup` and the `build_gleam_extraction_config` / `build_gleam_default_extraction_config` helpers are removed entirely. The `json_object` arg-type arm now falls back to a generic `json_to_gleam` JSON-string emission. `render_tagged_union_assertion` takes the package qualifier as a parameter (resolved by the caller from the gleam package config) instead of hardcoding `"kreuzberg"`. Note: the FFI plugin shim templates `plugin_impl_initialize.jinja` and `plugin_impl_shutdown.jinja` still construct `kreuzberg::KreuzbergError::Plugin { ... }` literals — that's a kreuzberg-specific error contract that needs a separate refactor (would require defining a generic plugin-error trait in alef-core, which downstreams implement). Tracked for iter16.
- feat(alef-core): introduce `[ffi] plugin_error_constructor` config knob — a Rust expression with access to a `msg: String` local that the FFI plugin shim templates (`plugin_impl_initialize`, `plugin_impl_shutdown`) interpolate verbatim when constructing the error value to return. When unset, the shim falls back to `<core_import::error_type as ::core::convert::From<String>>::from(msg)` so any error type implementing `From<String>` works out of the box. Removes the hardcoded `kreuzberg::KreuzbergError::Plugin { ... }` literal that previously locked the FFI plugin path to kreuzberg's specific error variant shape.
- feat(alef-core,alef-e2e/gleam): introduce `[crates.gleam] element_constructors` and `[crates.gleam] json_object_wrapper` config knobs to restore Gleam record-constructor support without baking downstream-specific knowledge into the codegen. `element_constructors` is a list of recipes keyed by the fixture-side `element_type` (e.g. `"BatchFileItem"`) — each declares a Gleam constructor identifier and a typed list of fields (`file_path` for fixture-relative paths, `byte_array` for `<<n1, n2, …>>` BitArrays, `string` with default, `literal` for constants). `json_object_wrapper` is a single template (`{json}` placeholder) used when no element_type matches; downstreams whose Gleam binding parses a JSON string into a config record (e.g. `kreuzberg.config_from_json_string({json})`) declare it once instead of having alef know the field shapes. Replaces the iter15-removed `BatchFileItem`/`BatchBytesItem`/`build_gleam_extraction_config` helpers.

## [0.15.25] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- fix(alef-e2e/typescript): emit `globalSetup` when any fixture uses mock-server — Vitest config now includes the global-setup hook for HTTP-bound or `mock_response`-tagged fixtures so the mock-server binary actually spawns before the test run starts.
- fix(alef-e2e/python): wrap `arg_bindings` in `pytest.raises(...)` and assert on `str(exc_info.value)` — error fixtures that include argument-construction expressions now catch deserialize-time failures inside the `with` block instead of letting them escape before the assertion.
- fix(alef-e2e/typescript): recursively walk nested type fields for wasm imports — class types referenced two or more levels deep (e.g. `WasmChatCompletionRequest.tools[].function: WasmFunctionDefinition`) were emitted in test bodies via `new WasmFunctionDefinition()` but missing from the import statement, causing `ReferenceError: WasmFunctionDefinition is not defined` at runtime. The single-level `derive_nested_types_for_wasm` is now wrapped by `collect_transitive_nested_types_for_wasm`, a BFS over the wasm class graph that follows every struct-typed field through `Vec`/`Optional`. Terminates on cycles via a `seen` set on wasm class names.
- fix(alef-cli): merge `excluded_type_paths` from each per-crate extraction in the multi-source extract pipeline so trait_bridge codegen can resolve qualified paths for excluded types referenced across crate boundaries.
- chore(alef): add `excluded_type_paths` field to all `ApiSurface { ... }` test literals across the workspace (~50 backend test/bench files) and `serde_flatten: false` to the matching `FieldDef` literals in the bench/snapshot suites. Mass-fix follow-up to the `feat(extract): preserve excluded type paths for trait_bridge codegen` IR change so `cargo check` and `cargo test` both stay green.

### Changed

- chore: cargo fmt sweep and sync `Cargo.lock` to 0.15.24 release pin.

## [0.15.24] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- feat(alef-core): `SelectWhen` enum and `resolve_call_for_fixture` — named call configs in `[e2e.calls.*]` can now declare `select_when = { input_has = "<key>" }` to auto-route fixtures whose input contains that key, without requiring an explicit `"call"` field on every fixture. All per-language e2e generators now use `resolve_call_for_fixture` instead of `resolve_call` so auto-routing applies everywhere.
- feat(alef-e2e/go): wrap engine creation in error-return for validation fixtures — when a test fixture has `type=error` assertions, `build_args_and_setup` now emits `return` instead of `t.Fatalf` if `CreateEngine` itself fails, so validation errors from engine creation satisfy the error assertion rather than failing the test.

### Changed

- alef-e2e/typescript: auto-derive nested-type wrapping from IR field types — `ts_builder_expression_inner` now resolves class-typed fields (`TypeRef::Named` and `TypeRef::Vec(Named)`) from the type registry, removing the need for manual `nested_types` mappings in alef.toml call overrides. Explicit overrides still win on collision.

### Added

- feat(alef-docs): render enums in shared `types.md` and `configuration.md` reference files. Previously enum variant tables only appeared in per-language `api-{lang}.md`, so downstream guides could not deep-link to enum sections from the language-neutral shared pages. `types.md` now gets every public enum under a new `### Enums` section; `configuration.md` gets the subset referenced as field types of any rendered config struct (matching on `TypeRef::Named` recursing through `Optional`/`Vec`/`Map`). Kreuzberg's `LayoutClass`, `HtmlTheme`, `TableModel`, `KeywordAlgorithm`, `OutputFormat`, `ResultFormat` (and analogous enums in any other downstream crate) now have stable `#enumname` anchors in both shared files. The shared rendering also adds a `Wire value` column when the enum carries `#[serde(rename_all = "...")]` or any per-variant `#[serde(rename = "...")]`, so users see the actual JSON/TOML token (e.g. `"default"`, `"slanet_wired"`) alongside the Rust variant name.

- feat(alef-core/ir): plumb `FieldDef.serde_flatten: bool` from the Rust source through the IR. Backends use this to emit language-native flatten support — see `feat(java-backend, csharp-backend)` below. The extractor recognises `#[serde(flatten)]` (also under `#[cfg_attr(...)]`) by anchoring on the `flatten` token boundary in the token-stream string.

- feat(java-backend, csharp-backend): emit language-native `#[serde(flatten)] serde_json::Value` support — Java records get `@JsonAnyGetter Map<String, Object>` on the record component plus a matching `@JsonAnySetter <field>Entry(String, Object)` on the builder (with `@JsonIgnore` on the regular `with<Field>(Map)` setter so a wire field of the same name is not miscast as a Map). C# classes get `[JsonExtensionData] Dictionary<string, JsonElement>` instead of `[JsonPropertyName(...)]`. Both implement the serde flatten semantic for types like `ResponseTool { tool_type, #[serde(flatten)] config: Value }` whose wire JSON is `{"type":"function","name":"f","description":"d"}` — without this, Jackson rejected `Unrecognized field "description" (class ResponseToolBuilder)` on every chat-tools request.

- alef-core: `CallOverride.assert_enum_fields` per-call override for routing result-field enum types in assertions.
- alef-e2e/python: thread per-call `assert_enum_fields` through `render_assertion` so same-named fields (e.g. `status`) can be enum in one call and string in another.

### Fixed

- alef-codegen, alef-docs: add `serde_flatten: false` to test-site `FieldDef` literals that were missing the field after iter10's plumbing.
- alef-e2e/java: add TCP-readiness probe to MockServerListener — polls the bound mock-server URL until accepting (max 5s, 50ms backoff) before releasing the JUnit launcher session, preventing intermittent `error sending request` failures under Surefire parallel execution.
- alef-e2e/csharp: add TCP-readiness probe to TestSetup `[ModuleInitializer]` — same polling logic; eliminates intermittent failures under xUnit class-parallel default.
- alef-e2e/typescript: emit numeric bracket access for digit-only JSON pointer segments in test assertions — e.g. `result.results[0]` instead of `result.results["0"]`. The string-keyed access returned `undefined`, breaking array-element assertions.

- fix(csharp-backend): branch sealed-union `JsonConverter<T>` Read on variant shape — struct variants (named fields like `OcrDocument::Url { url: String }`) skip the `"Value"` wrap so `JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Variant>(...)` sees `{"url":"..."}` directly and can match the `[JsonPropertyName("url")]` annotation on the variant record's positional component. Tuple variants (single-field tuple of named struct, e.g. `Message::User(UserMessage)`) keep the `"Value"` wrap as before. Without this, every struct-variant tagged union failed to round-trip — Rust serde rejected the FFI request with `missing field 'url' at line 1 column 73` because the C# layer dropped the field on serialize when the converter could not even deserialize it on the way in. The Read method now produces both `flatJson` (no wrap) and `wrappedJson` and dispatches per variant via the `is_tuple` IR flag.

- fix(e2e/csharp): env-gate live smoke fixtures (no `mock_response`, no `http` override, but `env.api_key_var` set) via early-return when the env var is unset. Without the gate, `task csharp:e2e:test` failed on `smoke_chat_anthropic`, `smoke_chat_gemini`, `smoke_chat_openai`, `smoke_streaming_openai`, `smoke_embed_openai`, `smoke_list_models_openai`, `smoke_provider_routing`, `smoke_cache_memory` with `not found: No mock route for /fixtures/<id>/...` because the mock-server has no fixture for them — they target real provider APIs. Mirrors the Elixir / Python conftest pattern. Both the regular `render_test_method` and `render_chat_stream_test_method` paths gain the gate.

- fix(java-backend): wrap `<Type>.fromJson(json)` deserialization failures in `<Crate>Exception` (the binding's checked exception class) instead of bare `RuntimeException`. The catch block now emits `throw new <Crate>Exception("Failed to parse <Type> from JSON: " + e.getMessage(), e)` and the method signature gains `throws <Crate>Exception` so callers must handle/declare it. Lets error fixtures asserting `assertThrows(<Crate>Exception.class, ...)` catch deserialize-time failures (e.g. `Cannot construct instance of FilePurpose, problem: Unknown value: invalid-purpose`) the same way they catch FFI failures. Mirror change in `untagged_union_wrapper.jinja`.

- fix(csharp-backend): emit a `public static T FromJson(string json)` factory on every generated record/class that wraps `System.Text.Json.JsonException` (and any other deserialization failure) in `<Crate>Exception`. The factory uses a `JsonOptions` field that mirrors the e2e-harness `ConfigOptions` (`JsonStringEnumConverter(SnakeCaseLower)` + `WhenWritingDefault`), so round-trips stay consistent with the FFI request-serialization path. Without this, malformed input JSON surfaced as a raw `JsonException` that error fixtures' `Assert.ThrowsAny<<Crate>Exception>(...)` did not catch. The e2e codegen now emits `<OptionsType>.FromJson("...")` instead of inlined `JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T>("...", ConfigOptions)!` so the wrap actually intercepts the parse step.

- fix(csharp-backend): generate a custom `JsonConverter<T>` for enums whose `#[serde(rename_all)]` is non-snake (`kebab-case`, `SCREAMING-KEBAB-CASE`, `camelCase`, `PascalCase`), not just for enums with explicit per-variant `serde_rename`. The global `JsonStringEnumConverter(SnakeCaseLower)` previously emitted `"fine_tune"` for `FilePurpose::FineTune` (`#[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]`), producing `"could not convert to FilePurpose"` on every read of `"fine-tune"`. The custom converter now explicitly maps `"fine-tune" → FilePurpose.FineTune` and writes `"fine-tune"` on the way back. Property-level `[JsonConverter(typeof(<Enum>JsonConverter))]` is also emitted on enum-typed fields so the override wins over the global naming policy.

- fix(e2e/java): wrap `setup_lines` (which may include `<Type>.fromJson(...)` calls that throw on malformed JSON) plus the `call_expr` inside the `assertThrows` lambda for `expects_error` fixtures. Without this, deserialize-time failures escaped before `assertThrows` could catch them — `var request = OcrRequest.fromJson("...invalid-purpose...")` threw outside the assertion. Mirrors the C# `Assert.ThrowsAnyAsync(() => client.X(Type.FromJson(...)))` pattern.

- fix(php-backend): do not append "Async" suffix to async method names in wrapper facade. The PHP binding blocks on async internally via `block_on`, presenting a synchronous API to callers. Wrapper facade methods now use the exact name from the IR (e.g. `scrape()` instead of `scrapeAsync()`), matching the configured function name in alef.toml e2e overrides. The underlying extension methods retain the "_async" suffix for internal delegation.

- fix(magnus-backend): emit valid serde attribute `#[serde(default = "default_timeout")]` (function path) instead of `#[serde(default = "30000")]` (literal string) for Duration-typed timeout fields. The invalid literal syntax caused compilation errors in Ruby e2e bindings. Added helper function `default_timeout() -> u64` to struct templates.

### Added

- feat(e2e/java): emit a JUnit Platform `LauncherSessionListener` (`MockServerListener`) and the matching SPI manifest under `src/test/resources/META-INF/services/` to spawn the mock-server binary once per launcher session whenever any fixture is HTTP-bound or carries `mock_response`. Mirrors the Ruby `spec_helper.rb` / Python `conftest.py` / Node `globalSetup.ts` / C `Makefile` spawn patterns. The listener parses the `MOCK_SERVER_URL=...` line from mock-server stdout, exposes it as the `mockServerUrl` JVM system property, and tears the child down via stdin-close on `launcherSessionClosed` (with a 2s timeout fallback to `destroyForcibly`). A pre-set `MOCK_SERVER_URL` env var skips the spawn entirely (CI / external orchestration). The pom.xml template gains a `dependencyManagement` import of `org.junit:junit-bom` and an explicit `org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher` test dependency so the SPI lookup actually finds the listener interface. Generated test bodies now read `System.getProperty("mockServerUrl", System.getenv("MOCK_SERVER_URL"))` so external overrides still work without going through JNI's lack of `setenv`. Without this, every fixture-bound Java test failed with `LiterLlmRsException: error sending request for url (null/fixtures/<id>/...)` whenever `task java:e2e:test` ran standalone, because nothing in the Java toolchain spawned the mock-server.

- feat(e2e/csharp): extend the `[ModuleInitializer] TestSetup.Init` block to spawn the mock-server binary before the assembly loads whenever any fixture is HTTP-bound or carries `mock_response`. Walks ancestor directories of `AppContext.BaseDirectory` to locate the repo root (the directory containing `test_documents/`), resolves `e2e/rust/target/release/mock-server` (`.exe` on Windows), starts it via `Process` with redirected stdin/stdout/stderr, parses the `MOCK_SERVER_URL=...` line, and calls `Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("MOCK_SERVER_URL", url)`. Drains stdout/stderr in background daemon threads to keep the child unblocked, and registers an `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.ProcessExit` handler that closes the child's stdin (mock-server treats stdin EOF as a shutdown signal) and falls back to `Process.Kill(true)` after a 2s grace. Honors a pre-set `MOCK_SERVER_URL` by skipping the spawn (CI / external orchestration). Without this, `task csharp:e2e:test` standalone produced 47/161 with 114 `LiterLlmException : builder error` failures because reqwest rejected the relative path `"" + "/fixtures/<id>"` when `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MOCK_SERVER_URL")` returned null.

- feat(csharp-backend): emit a proper `Write` method for sealed-union `JsonConverter<T>`. The previous implementation threw `NotSupportedException` from `Write`, so any C# binding that serialized a sealed union (e.g. a `Message.User` instance inside a `ChatCompletionRequest`) failed at the FFI marshalling step with `Message serialization is not supported`. The new converter mirrors the Java sealed-union serializer pattern: switch on the variant, write the discriminator tag, then flatten the inner record's fields alongside the tag (so `Message.User(UserMessage value)` round-trips as `{"role":"user","content":...}` not `{"value":{...}}`). Emitted via a new `sealed_union_converter.jinja` template that owns both the Read and Write methods and replaces ~190 lines of inline `out.push_str` calls.

### Fixed

- fix(csharp-backend): null-marshal `Optional<&T>` (`TypeRef::Named` + `optional: true`) parameters by passing `IntPtr.Zero` instead of round-tripping the literal string `"null"` through `<Type>FromJson`. Without this, `client.ListBatches(null)` against `Option<&BatchListQuery>` failed with `invalid type: null, expected struct BatchListQuery`. Mirrors the Java fix for the same IR shape. Emitted via a new `named_param_handle_from_json_optional.jinja` template.

- fix(csharp-backend): respect `#[serde(rename = "...")]` when emitting `[JsonPropertyName("...")]` on record properties. Previously the generator hardcoded `field.name` as the JSON wire name, so fields like `tool_type` (renamed via `#[serde(rename = "type")]`) round-tripped as `"tool_type"` on the wire — Rust serde then rejected the request with `unknown field tool_type, expected type or function`. Now uses `field.serde_rename` when set, falling back to `field.name`.

- fix(csharp-backend): retrieve the actual FFI error message instead of throwing a generic `"<NativeMethod> failed"`. The `null_result_throw.jinja` template now reads `LastErrorCode()` + `LastErrorContext()` and surfaces the underlying Rust error (e.g. `"missing field 'role'"`, `"invalid type: null, expected struct BatchListQuery"`) so callers see the real cause instead of a meaningless wrapper.

- fix(csharp-backend): check the return value of `<Type>FromJson` and throw the actual error before passing the (potentially-null) handle to the next FFI call. Without this, a malformed serialized JSON silently returned `IntPtr.Zero`, then the next FFI call failed with `Null pointer passed for parameter 'req'` — masking the real serialization error. The `named_param_handle_from_json.jinja` template now checks the handle and throws with the underlying error context. Same pattern as the existing Java emission.

- fix(e2e/csharp): use `JsonNamingPolicy.SnakeCaseLower.ConvertName(value.ToString())` for enum-equality assertions instead of `.ToString()?.ToLower()`. C# enum members are PascalCase (`InProgress`, `ContentFilter`, `ToolCalls`), so `.ToLower()` produces `inprogress`, `contentfilter`, `toolcalls` — none of which match the snake_case wire format (`in_progress`, `content_filter`, `tool_calls`) that the global `JsonStringEnumConverter(JsonNamingPolicy.SnakeCaseLower)` actually emits.

- fix(java-backend, csharp-backend): handle `#[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]` (and `SCREAMING-KEBAB-CASE`) on enums. Both `apply_rename_all` helpers had no `kebab-case` arm, so they fell through to `name.to_lowercase()`, producing `FineTune` → `"finetune"` instead of `"fine-tune"`. JSON values like `"fine-tune"` then failed to deserialize with `Cannot construct instance of FilePurpose, problem: Unknown value: fine-tune` (3 Java tests, all C# file-purpose tests).

- fix(java-backend): null-marshal `TypeRef::Named` parameters with `optional: true`. The IR represents `Option<&BatchListQuery>` as `TypeRef::Named("BatchListQuery") + optional: true` after FFI extraction strips the `Option`. The Java instance-method emitter only branched on `TypeRef::Optional(Named)`, taking the unconditional path for `Named + optional`: `STREAM_MAPPER.writeValueAsString(null)` yielded the literal `"null"`, then `LITERLLM_BATCH_LIST_QUERY_FROM_JSON("null")` failed inside Rust serde with `invalid type: null, expected struct BatchListQuery at line 1 column 4`. The path now branches on `p.optional` for `TypeRef::Named` and emits `if (param == null) { cParam = MemorySegment.NULL; } else { ... }`, mirroring the existing `TypeRef::Optional(Named)` arm. Fixes `client.listBatches(null)` / `client.listFiles(null)` against `Option<&BatchListQuery>` / `Option<&FileListQuery>` (4 Java tests).

- fix(java-backend): emit `@JsonProperty(<wire-name>)` on builder field declarations when the core field has explicit `#[serde(rename = "...")]`. Without this, fields like `StreamToolCall.call_type` (renamed from `r#type` to `call_type` to avoid Java's contextual-keyword conflict, with `#[serde(rename = "type")]` to keep wire-name `"type"`) deserialize JSON like `{"type":"function"}` via Jackson's `BuilderBasedDeserializer` and fail with `Unrecognized field "type" (class StreamToolCallBuilder), not marked as ignorable (4 known properties: function, index, id, call_type)`. The builder field declarations now mirror the record-component annotation so wire-name lookup succeeds.

### Added

- feat(csharp-backend): emit JsonElement-wrapper records for `#[serde(untagged)]` enums, mirroring the Java backend's Stage A wrapper pattern. Untagged unions like `EmbeddingInput = Single(String) | Multiple(Vec<String>)`, `UserContent = String | Vec<UserContentBlock>`, `ToolChoice = String | Object`, `StopSequence = String | Vec<String>` previously emitted as plain C# `enum`s; System.Text.Json's default enum converter rejected any non-variant-name value (e.g. `"Hello world"` for `EmbeddingInput`) with `JsonException: The JSON value could not be converted to LiterLlm.EmbeddingInput`. The new emission produces a `sealed class T : IEquatable<T>` holding a `JsonElement Value`, with a paired `JsonConverter<T>` that round-trips the raw JSON. Static factories (`Of(string)`, `Of(IEnumerable<string>)`, `OfObject(object)`, `FromJson(string)`) and probe accessors (`AsString()`, `AsList()`, `AsObject()`) keep ergonomic construction available. Field references stay strongly typed (e.g. `EmbeddingRequest.Input` is `EmbeddingInput`, not `JsonElement`) since `gen_bindings/mod.rs.complex_enums` is now empty — the wrapper class itself is the proper field type. Emitted via a new `untagged_union_wrapper.jinja` template registered in `template_env.rs`.

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/csharp): merge per-call C# `enum_fields` into the effective field-enum set used by `render_assertion`. The C# codegen resolved `enum_fields` once from the file-level `[crates.csharp].enum_fields` (top-level) and ignored per-call overrides like `[crates.e2e.calls.retrieve_batch.overrides.csharp].enum_fields`, so call-specific enum-typed result fields (e.g. `status` returning `BatchStatus` on retrieve_batch / cancel_batch / create_batch) never triggered the enum-coercion branch (`?.ToString()?.ToLower()`). The result was `result.Status!.Trim()` against `BatchStatus?` — a compile error (`'BatchStatus?' does not contain a definition for 'Trim'`). `render_test_method` now merges `cs_overrides.enum_fields` keys into the effective set before passing it to `render_assertion`, mirroring the Java fix from 5692d176.

- fix(java-backend): mark the untagged-union wrapper boilerplate (`asString` / `asList` / `asObject` / `equals` / `hashCode` / `toString` block, ~170 tokens) with `// CPD-OFF` / `// CPD-ON` sentinels so PMD's copy-paste detector does not flag the intentional duplication across `EmbeddingInput`, `ModerationInput`, `RerankDocument`, and other untagged-wrapper classes. The duplication is the price of avoiding a generic base class; the sentinels are the standard CPD suppression mechanism. Liter-llm's `packages/java/pom.xml` separately bumps `<minimumTokens>` to 200 to clear the pre-existing 124-token DefaultClient FFI byte-buffer block that the maven-pmd-plugin's `cpd-check` goal also flags.

- fix(e2e/brew): emit `jq -r '<path> // empty'` for `is_empty` assertions so a JSON `null` value becomes an empty string instead of the literal `"null"`. Without this, fixtures that asserted `is_empty` on optional fields (e.g. `metadata.og_title` on a page that omits Open Graph tags) failed because `jq -r .metadata.og_title` prints `null` and the bash assertion treated that as a non-empty value. Restores brew/CLI e2e parity with the other backends, which compare against language-native null.

- fix(e2e/java): merge per-call `enum_fields` into the file-level java enum_fields used by `render_assertion`. The Java codegen resolved enum_fields once from `[crates.e2e.call.overrides.java].enum_fields` (top-level) and ignored per-call overrides like `[crates.e2e.calls.chat.overrides.java].enum_fields`, so call-specific enum-typed result fields (e.g. `choices[0].finish_reason` returning `FinishReason`, `status` returning `BatchStatus` on retrieve_batch/cancel_batch) never triggered the Optional<Enum> coercion path added in 51fb7656. The result was `Optional.ofNullable(x).orElse("")` against `Optional<FinishReason>` (`incompatible types: java.lang.String cannot be converted to FinishReason`) and `BatchStatus.trim()` (`cannot find symbol: method trim()`). `render_test_method` now merges `call_overrides.enum_fields` over the file-level map before passing it down so per-call enum classifications take precedence.

- fix(napi-scaffold): include `napi/serde-json` feature for crates with Json fields. The NAPI scaffolder emitted `napi = { version = "3", features = ["async"] }` unconditionally, but when the API surface contained any `TypeRef::Json` field (e.g. `data: Option<serde_json::Value>`), the binding failed to compile with `error[E0277]: the trait 'ToNapiValue' is not implemented for 'std::option::Option<Value>'` because the `napi/serde-json` feature is required to marshal JSON types. The scaffolder now detects Json types recursively across struct fields, method parameters/returns, function parameters/returns, and enum variants; when any Json type is found, it adds `"serde-json"` to the napi features list. This restores kreuzcrawl-node and other bindings with Json fields to compatibility without hand-edits.

- fix(e2e/rust): support array-form `input.mock_responses` schema in mock-server template. The Rust e2e test template's `render_mock_server_setup` only recognized the single-response schema (`mock_response: { status, body, stream_chunks, headers }`), silently discarding the multi-response array schema (`input.mock_responses: [{ path, status_code, headers, body_inline, body_file }, ...]`) used by kreuzcrawl and other fixture-heavy projects. The kreuzcrawl standalone mock-server (`tools/mock-server/src/main.rs`) correctly loaded 452 routes from 246 fixture files, but the alef-generated `e2e/rust/src/main.rs` loaded only 20, because the template never examined `fixture.input.get("mock_responses")`. The fix extends `render_mock_server_setup` to first check for the array schema (extracting `path`, `status_code`, `headers`, and `body_inline` from each element; defaulting path to "/" and status to 200), fall back to the single-response schema if absent, emit multiple `MockRoute` objects when the array contains multiple elements, and emit a single route when either schema produces exactly one response. The standalone binary's `load_routes_recursive` function continues to handle both schemas including `body_file` (fixture-relative file loading), while the test-function template (which lacks fixture-dir context) emits placeholder bodies for `body_file` entries — the binaries will be tested separately against the real file paths. Restores e2e fixture coverage for array-based mock-response projects.

## [0.15.23] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(scaffold-swift): drop `swift-actions/setup-swift@v2` from the generated Swift CI workflow and rely on the macos-latest runner's bundled Xcode toolchain. The third-party action installs a Swift 6.0 toolchain that is binary-incompatible with Xcode 16.4's XCTest framework, so swiftpm test bundles fail to load `XCTestCore.framework` at runtime (`Library not loaded: @rpath/XCTestCore.framework/Versions/A/XCTestCore`). The macos-latest runner already ships Xcode 16+ with Swift 6 on `PATH`, so no extra setup step is required. The step is replaced with a diagnostic `swift --version` step.

## [0.15.22] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(backend-swift): re-wire `emit_e2e_wrappers` and `emit_json_factory_shims` so the kreuzberg-style e2e helpers (`extractionConfigFromJson`, `batchBytesItemFromJson`, `batchFileItemFromJson`) are emitted again. Emission is gated structurally on the api surface exposing all three serde-enabled types (`ExtractionConfig`, `BatchBytesItem`, `BatchFileItem`) — this keeps the helper out of binding crates that don't expose those types while restoring the symbols the alef-e2e Swift codegen still calls (`crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/swift.rs:762`). Without the helpers, every kreuzberg-derived Swift test suite failed at compile with `cannot find 'extractionConfigFromJson' in scope`. Also drops the broken multi-line `out.push_str` in `batchExtractBytesSync` that produced stray indentation.

## [0.15.21] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(scaffold-swift): replace the unsafe `printf "import RustBridgeC\n$(cat …)"` form in the generated Swift workflow and BUILDING.md template with `{ echo "import RustBridgeC"; cat …; }`. printf interprets `%` and `\` sequences in its format string, so the substituted swift-bridge source content was being silently corrupted whenever it contained those characters — surfacing in CI as `cannot find type 'RustString' in scope` errors in hand-authored Swift sibling files (e.g. `Plugins.swift`) because the copied `SwiftBridgeCore.swift` lost its `RustString` declaration. The new echo+cat form has no format-string interpretation and is robust against arbitrary byte content. Applied to the `swift.yml` workflow Copy step and to both the debug and release sections of `BUILDING.md`. Regression assertions added to `test_scaffold_swift`.

## [0.15.20] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- feat(backend-swift): emit `extern "Swift"` plugin trait bridges so a Swift class can implement a Rust plugin trait and have Rust call back into Swift. For each configured `[[crates.trait_bridges]]` entry the swift bridge crate now produces, alongside the existing outbound `{Trait}Box` glue: an `extern "Swift" type Swift{Trait}Box` declaration with one FFI shim per method (plus `name`/`version`/`initialize`/`shutdown` Plugin shims), a Rust `Swift{Trait}Wrapper` newtype with `OnceLock<String>` name cache and `unsafe impl Send + Sync`, a `Plugin` super-trait impl forwarding to the Swift box (mapping `Result<_, String>` to `KreuzbergError::Plugin`), an `#[async_trait] impl {Trait}` forwarding each method through the Swift FFI shims with JSON marshalling for complex types, and `register_*`/`unregister_*` free functions exposed via an additional `extern "Rust"` block (`#[swift_bridge(swift_name = "registerXxx")]`) that wrap the wrapper in `Arc` and insert it into the configured `registry_getter`. Complex types are JSON-bridged at the FFI boundary (every `Named` type, all `Optional`/`Map`/non-leaf `Vec`); primitives, `String`, `Vec<u8>`, and `Vec<leaf>` pass through directly. ARC lifecycle: swift-bridge's `extern "Swift" type` declaration retains the Swift instance via `Unmanaged<T>.passRetained` and releases it on `Drop`, so storing the wrapper in a process-wide `Arc<dyn Trait>` registry is ARC-safe — the Swift instance lives until the registry's last `Arc` clone is dropped. The generated `Cargo.toml` gains an `async-trait = "0.1"` dependency since the inbound trait impl uses `#[async_trait]` to mirror the source crate's async trait shape. User-facing `Sources/<Module>/Plugins.swift` (Swift protocols + `Swift{Trait}Box` adapter classes) is left for the consuming binding to author by hand — swift-bridge requires a Swift class named exactly `Swift{Trait}Box` with the matching `alefSwift*` method names, which the Rust-side codegen documents in struct doc comments.

## [0.15.19] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(backend-swift): drop the bogus `.toString()` suffix on `String` and `Json` returns from convenience overloads. swift-bridge maps a Rust `String` return (bare or inside `Result<String, _>`) directly to a Swift-native `String` — there is no `RustString` wrapping to unwrap. Calling `.toString()` on a Swift `String` failed at the call site with `error: value of type 'String' has no member 'toString'`. The conversion suffix is now only emitted for `RustVec<T>` returns (Bytes, `Vec<primitive>`), where `.map { $0 }` is still needed to materialise the `Sequence` into a Swift `Array`.

- fix(backend-swift): skip emitting convenience overloads when the public wrapper name would collide with the bridge function name (i.e. when the IR function name has no `_sync` suffix to strip). The v0.15.18 fix incorrectly assumed Swift overload resolution would disambiguate the labeled overload from the unlabeled bridge function based on argument-label inclusion — in practice Swift's resolver still treats the in-file labeled candidate as a match for the unlabeled positional inner call, producing `error: no exact matches in call to global function 'renderPdfPageToPng'` and `'detectMimeTypeFromBytes'`. Module-prefix qualification (`RustBridge.fn(...)`) is rejected by Swift for free functions imported from another module, so there is no clean disambiguation path. We now skip the convenience overload entirely when `wrapper_name == swift_inner`; the bridge function remains callable directly with `makeByteVec(...)`. Restores local `swift build` against `kreuzberg/packages/swift` to a clean compile.

## [0.15.18] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(backend-swift): drop the bogus `RustBridge.` qualifier introduced in v0.15.16. Swift rejects `ModuleName.functionName` qualification of free functions imported from another module — the v0.15.16 emission `RustBridge.detectMimeTypeFromBytes(...)` failed at the call site with `error: module 'RustBridge' has no member named 'detectMimeTypeFromBytes'`, even though the function is `public func` at module scope in the swift-bridge-generated source. The original shadowing diagnosis was wrong: convenience overloads use a labeled first parameter (`content: String` / `content: [UInt8]` / `path: String`), the underlying bridge function uses an unlabeled first parameter (`_ content: RustVec<UInt8>`), and Swift overload resolution disambiguates by argument-label inclusion. A positional inner call `detectMimeTypeFromBytes(makeByteVec(...))` resolves unambiguously to the bridge function regardless of which other same-named labeled overloads exist in the same module. The codegen now always emits the unqualified inner call, restoring local `swift build` against `kreuzberg/packages/swift` to a clean compile.

## [0.15.17] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- feat(backend-dart): emit `register_*` / `unregister_*` forwarders for `[[trait_bridges]]` entries that set `register_fn` (and optionally `unregister_fn`) plus `registry_getter`. The Dart backend previously emitted only the `{Trait}DartImpl` opaque struct, the trait impl, and the `create_*_dart_impl` factory — leaving Dart consumers no way to actually install their callbacks into the host registry. The codegen now appends `pub fn {register_fn}(impl_: {Trait}DartImpl) -> Result<(), String>` (wrapping `impl_` in `Arc<dyn Trait>` and calling `registry_getter().write().register(arc{register_extra_args})`) and, when `unregister_fn` is set, `pub fn {unregister_fn}(name: String) -> Result<(), String>` (calling `registry_getter().write().remove(&name)`). Both forwarders stringify the host-typed error since FRB requires owned, FFI-safe error types. FRB auto-bridges these `pub fn` items, so Dart sees `Future<void> registerOcrBackend(OcrBackendDartImpl impl_)` / `Future<void> unregisterOcrBackend(String name)` directly. Going through the registry handle (rather than the host crate's `register_*` free function) sidesteps `pub(crate)` / `#[cfg(test)]` restrictions on trait registration wrappers, notably for `EmbeddingBackend`. Closes the last gap for Dart plugin trait callbacks.

## [0.15.16] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(backend-swift): qualify the convenience-overload inner call with `RustBridge.` when the wrapper has the same Swift name as the underlying bridge function. When the IR function name lacked a `_sync` suffix to strip, `wrapper_name` equalled `swift_inner` and the same-module convenience overloads (e.g. `detectMimeTypeFromBytes(content:)` and `renderPdfPageToPng(content:pageIndex:dpi:password:)`) shadowed the imported bridge declarations from `RustBridge`. The inner call `try detectMimeTypeFromBytes(makeByteVec(...)).toString()` resolved to the convenience overload itself — returning a Swift `String` that has no `.toString()` member — and `try renderPdfPageToPng(makeByteVec(content), pageIndex, dpi, password)` produced `error: no exact matches in call to global function 'renderPdfPageToPng'` because the same-module candidates require labels (`content:pageIndex:dpi:password:`). The codegen now emits `RustBridge.<name>(...)` whenever the wrapper would otherwise self-shadow, routing the call to the positional swift-bridge wrapper without relying on import-shadow resolution order.

## [0.15.15] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(scaffold-swift): generated `.github/workflows/swift.yml` now builds the `{crate}-swift` Rust crate and copies the swift-bridge generated headers and Swift sources into `Sources/RustBridgeC/` and `Sources/RustBridge/` before invoking `swift build`. Previously the workflow ran `swift build` directly with `working-directory: packages/swift`, but `Sources/RustBridgeC/RustBridgeC.h` is only a placeholder until `cargo build -p {crate}-swift` produces the real combined header in `target/debug/build/{crate}-swift-*/out/`. CI failed with hundreds of `cannot find '__swift_bridge__$Vec_<Type>$<method>' in scope` errors because the C symbols and Swift bridge wrappers were never copied into the SwiftPM targets. The new workflow installs the Rust toolchain before Swift, runs `cargo build -p {crate}-swift` at the repo root, concatenates `SwiftBridgeCore.h` and `{crate}-swift/{crate}-swift.h` into `Sources/RustBridgeC/RustBridgeC.h`, prepends `import RustBridgeC` to the generated `SwiftBridgeCore.swift` and `{crate}-swift.swift` files (writing them into `Sources/RustBridge/`), then runs `swift build` and `swift test` from `packages/swift`. Mirrors the canonical sequence documented in the scaffolded `BUILDING.md`.

## [0.15.14] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(scaffold-kotlin): exclude the alef-emitted Kotlin binding-class file (e.g. `Kreuzberg.kt`) from the ktlint check in the generated `packages/kotlin/build.gradle.kts`. The alef-backend-kotlin emits the binding object with parameters on a single line, no expression bodies, and blank lines inside method blocks — patterns that ktlint flags as `parameter-list-wrapping`, `function-expression-body`, and `no-blank-lines-in-block` violations. The scaffold's `ktlint { filter { ... } }` block now adds `exclude { entry -> entry.file.toString().endsWith("/<BindingClass>.kt") }` (where `<BindingClass>` is `config.name` pascal-cased) so the generated file passes CI without hand-edits while still linting all user-authored Kotlin sources.

## [0.15.13] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(scaffold-gleam): bump `gleam-version` in the generated `.github/workflows/gleam.yml` from `1.4` to `1.14`. The latest `gleam_stdlib` requires Gleam `>= 1.14.0`, so CI failed with `Incompatible Gleam version` on every fresh scaffold using the default toolchain pin.

- fix(scaffold-swift): bump `swift-version` in the generated `.github/workflows/swift.yml` from `5.10` to `6.0`. The scaffolded `Package.swift` declares Swift tools 6.0, so CI failed with `package 'swift' is using Swift tools version 6.0.0 but the installed version is 5.10.1` whenever the workflow ran.

- fix(scaffold-kotlin): emit the generated `packages/kotlin/build.gradle.kts` with 2-space indentation matching the `[*.gradle.kts] indent_size = 2` rule already declared in the scaffolded `.editorconfig`. The template previously emitted 4-space indent, which ktlint flagged via `ktlintKotlinScriptCheck` against the build script itself. Also drops the redundant `${rootDir}/...` braces in the JNA `libPath` assignment to silence the matching ktlint warning.

## [0.15.9] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/elixir): coerce enum atom fields via `to_string/1` before string comparisons. Rustler binds Rust enums as Elixir atoms (e.g. `:stop` for `FinishReason::Stop`), so `String.trim/1` on `result.choices[0].finish_reason` raised `FunctionClauseError: no function clause matching in String.trim/1` on every chat fixture asserting `finish_reason == "stop"`. `render_assertion` now consults `[crates.e2e].fields_enum` (matched against both the raw fixture path and the resolved alias) and wraps the accessor in `to_string(...)` for `equals` assertions, mirroring the existing Ruby/Python coercion paths.

- fix(e2e/elixir): drop `_async` suffix for streaming entry-points. `[crates.e2e.calls.chat_stream]` is marked `async = true`, but the Elixir binding exposes the streaming wrapper as `defaultclient_chat_stream/2` (no `_async` suffix — it drives the FFI iterator handle synchronously, returning a `Stream`). The codegen unconditionally appended `_async`, producing `LiterLlm.defaultclient_chat_stream_async/2 is undefined` on every stream fixture. The two suffix sites (`render_test_files` and `render_test_case`) now skip the suffix when the resolved base function name ends with `_stream`.

- fix(e2e/elixir): plumb `extra_args` from per-language overrides. `[crates.e2e.calls.list_files.overrides.elixir]` and `[crates.e2e.calls.list_batches.overrides.elixir]` configure `extra_args = ["nil"]` to fill the trailing `Option<String> query` slot, but the Elixir codegen ignored them — emitting `defaultclient_list_files_async(client)` against a `/2` arity binding (`UndefinedFunctionError: did you mean defaultclient_list_files_async/2`). `render_test_case` now reads `call_overrides.extra_args` and appends them after configured args before prefixing the client variable, mirroring the Ruby/Go/Node/C# generators.

- fix(e2e/elixir): env-gate live smoke fixtures via `OPENAI_API_KEY in [nil, ""]`. Smoke fixtures without `mock_response` (e.g. `smoke_chat_openai`, `smoke_streaming_openai`) target real provider APIs; absent env keys yielded `MatchError: {:error, "no mock route ..."}` rather than a clean skip. The codegen now emits an `if System.get_env("<api_key_var>") in [nil, ""] do :ok else <test body> end` wrapper when `fixture.env.api_key_var` is set and there's no mock_response/http override, mirroring the Python conftest skip pattern. Both the early-return `expects_error` path and the assertion path close the `else` block.

- fix(e2e/elixir): support `result_is_simple` for raw-byte returns (`speech`, `file_content`). The Elixir binding returns the audio/content bytes directly as a binary, but the codegen emitted `assert result.audio != ""` against the binary, raising `BadMapError: expected a map`. `render_test_case` now reads `result_is_simple` from the resolved call override, and `render_assertion` bypasses the field accessor (and the `is_valid_for_result` skip) when set, asserting against the bound `result` variable directly. Mirrors the existing Ruby/PHP `result_is_simple` path. Combined with adding `Default` to `OcrRequest` (allowing the rustler backend to marshal it as `Option<String>` JSON), drops Elixir e2e failures from 68 → 0.

- fix(e2e/typescript+wasm): assert against `EnumClass.Variant`, wrap numeric assertions in `Number(...)`, plumb `extra_args`, and replace empty-input `{}` with no positional args. Four WASM-specific assertion regressions made cross-language e2e fail with `result.choices[0].finishReason.trim is not a function` (wasm-bindgen exposes Rust enums as numeric discriminants, not strings), `expected 15n to be 15` (`u64`/`i64` getters return BigInt — comparing against a JS Number with `.toBe()` always fails on `Object.is` equality), `expected instance of WasmFileListQuery / WasmBatchListQuery` (zero-arg `list_files()`/`list_batches()` was emitted as `listFiles({}, undefined)` because the codegen always dumped the fixture's `{}` input as the first arg), and `extra_args` configured per-language but never consumed by the typescript/wasm generator. The fix: (1) adds `result_enum_fields: HashMap<String, String>` to `CallOverride`, used by `render_assertion` to emit `expect(field).toBe(EnumClass.Variant)` (PascalCase-converted) when the assertion field path matches — the enum class is auto-imported alongside the request type. (2) For numeric `equals` / `<` / `<=` / `>` / `>=` on WASM, wraps the field expression in `Number(...)` so BigInt and Number compare equal. (3) Plumbs `extra_args` through `render_test_case` for both `node` and `wasm` lang keys. (4) When a call has no configured args and the fixture input is an empty object, returns an empty `args_str` so `extra_args = ["undefined"]` becomes the sole call argument. Drops liter-llm's WASM e2e failures from 51 → 18 (143/161 passing).

- fix(e2e/c): pass `MOCK_SERVER_URL/fixtures/<id>` as `base_url` and spawn the mock-server from the generated Makefile. Every `mock_response`/`http` fixture now has its `client = create_client("test-key", base_url, ...)` constructed against the per-fixture mock-server route, mirroring the Python/Ruby/Java/Dart codegen pattern. Without this, every C test that asserts `result != NULL` failed at the FFI boundary because the default OpenAI URL with a fake `"test-key"` could never serve a mocked response (e.g. `test_edge_batch_empty_list` aborted with `assert(result != NULL && "expected call to succeed")` at the first non-error fixture). The Makefile `test:` target now spawns `../rust/target/release/mock-server ../../fixtures` over a FIFO (so stdin stays open), parses the printed `MOCK_SERVER_URL=...` line, exports it for the test process, and tears the server down on exit. Honors a pre-set `MOCK_SERVER_URL` by skipping the spawn. The C `render_test_function`, `render_bytes_test_function`, and `render_chat_stream_test_function` paths all consult `Fixture::needs_mock_server()` and emit the per-fixture `getenv("MOCK_SERVER_URL")` + `snprintf` setup before the `create_client` call.

- fix(e2e/java): emit FQN imports for binding types and split imports onto separate lines. Previously the Java codegen derived the binding package only when `class_name` itself was fully-qualified (rare); the more common unqualified case (e.g. `class_name = "LiterLlm"`) left `import_path = ""`, so every dependent import branch — `all_options_types`, `enum_types_used`, `nested_types_used`, `CrawlConfig`, visitor types — fell back to bare type names like `import ChatCompletionRequest;`, which javac rejects with `'.' expected`. The fix threads the resolved `[crates.java] package` (via `config.java_package()`) into `render_test_file` as `binding_pkg` and routes every binding-type import through that package, with the per-class FQN derived from `import_path` retained as a secondary fallback. The class-itself import (`import {binding_pkg}.{ClassName};`) is now emitted when `class_name` is unqualified, fixing `cannot find symbol: class LiterLlm` on every test file. The `templates/java/test_file.jinja` import block also dropped the `{%-` whitespace-strip on `endfor`, which had collapsed every `{{ imp }}` and the `package` line into a single physical line — imports now render one per line as required by Java syntax. Bonus: the `templates/java/assertion.jinja` `equals` branch handles `value: null` fixtures (which deserialize to `Option<Value> = None` under `#[serde(default)]`) by emitting `assertTrue(...isEmpty(), "expected null")` against the unwrapped Optional accessor instead of `assertEquals(, ...)` — the latter was an empty-token-list compile error in every fixture asserting on a nullable field.

- fix(php-backend/enum-tainted): emit `..Default::default()` in `From<Binding> for Core` impls when the core type has cfg-stripped fields. The enum-tainted From-impl emitter (`gen_enum_tainted_from_binding_to_core`) iterates `typ.fields`, but cfg-gated fields are absent from the IR, so the resulting `Self { … }` initializer was missing those fields entirely — `error[E0063]: missing field 'browser_pool' in initializer of kreuzcrawl::CrawlConfig`. The two templates `php_impl_from_begin.jinja` / `php_impl_from_end.jinja` now accept a `has_stripped_cfg_fields` flag (passed through `typ.has_stripped_cfg_fields`); when set, the begin template adds `#[allow(clippy::needless_update)]` and the end template emits `..Default::default()` before closing the struct literal. Mirrors the existing handling in `binding_to_core_impl.jinja` for the non-tainted path.

- fix(codegen/structs): exclude data-enum opaque wrappers from `#[serde(skip)]` on parent fields. The PyO3 (and any future serde-aware) backend used to add `#[serde(skip)]` to every field whose type referenced any name in `opaque_type_names`, which now also includes data-enum wrappers (e.g. `Message`, `StopSequence`, `ToolChoice`, `ResponseFormat`). Those wrappers are emitted via `gen_pyo3_data_enum` with hand-rolled forwarding `serde::Serialize`/`Deserialize` impls that delegate to the core type, so the skip silently dropped the field on JSON round-trips: `ChatCompletionRequest::from_json('{"messages":[…]}').messages` produced `[]`, breaking every binding-level `from_json` round-trip and surfacing as `BadRequestError: Invalid 'messages': empty array` against real provider APIs. The fix introduces a new `serializable_opaque_type_names: &[String]` field on `RustBindingConfig`; `gen_struct_with_per_field_attrs` and `gen_struct_with_rename` exclude fields referencing names in this slice from the skip rule. The PyO3 backend populates it with `data_enum_names` (cloned before the existing `opaque_names_vec.extend(data_enum_names)` move) — fields referencing data-enum wrappers now serialize/deserialize through the forwarding impls instead of defaulting to empty.
- fix(e2e/c): emit `uint64_t` / `int32_t` / `double` / `bool` for primitive leaf accessors instead of `char*`. The C codegen previously hardcoded `char* {local} = {prefix}_{type}_{field}({handle});` for every leaf field, then routed every assertion through `strcmp` / `str_trim_eq`. FFI signatures like `uint64_t literllm_usage_total_tokens(...)` and `double literllm_rerank_result_relevance_score(...)` thus failed to compile (`incompatible integer to pointer conversion initializing 'char *' with 'uint64_t'`, `invalid operands to binary expression ('char *' and 'double')`). The new path consults a `[e2e.fields_c_types]` lookup for `"{parent_snake_type}.{field}"` — when the resolved type is a primitive C scalar (`uint64_t`, `int32_t`, `uint32_t`, `int64_t`, `double`, `float`, `bool`, …), the codegen emits the typed local declaration, switches `equals` assertions to `==` (mapping JSON booleans to `1` / `0` for `bool` slots), and skips the `char*` free at end-of-test. Both `emit_nested_accessor` (returning `Option<String>` for the leaf primitive) and the non-nested accessor branch consult the lookup. `render_assertion` gains a `primitive_locals: &HashMap<String, String>` parameter to dispatch numeric vs string comparisons.
- fix(e2e/c): support `string` and optional pointer args in the client-factory pattern. The C codegen previously processed only `arg_type == "json_object"` args in the client pattern (constructing handles via `_from_json` and passing them positionally), silently dropping every other arg type — so `cancel_batch(client, batch_id)`, `retrieve_file(client, file_id)`, etc. emitted `cancel_batch(client)` and failed to compile (`too few arguments to function call, expected 2, have 1`). The new path adds an `else if arg.arg_type == "string"` branch that reads `fixture.input.<field>`, escapes via `escape_c`, and emits the value as a C string literal `"value"` inline; an `else if arg.optional` branch passes `NULL` for missing optional arg slots; and the method-call argument string concatenates request handles + inline args together. Resolves the `cancel_batch` / `retrieve_batch` / `retrieve_file` / `delete_file` / `retrieve_response` / `cancel_response` compile errors.
- fix(e2e/c): honor `extra_args` from per-language overrides. The C codegen now reads `extra_args` from `[crates.e2e.calls.<name>.overrides.c]` (mirroring Rust/Go/Ruby/Node) and appends them verbatim after configured `args`. Used to pass `NULL` for trailing optional pointer slots in FFI signatures the fixture cannot supply directly (e.g. `*const FileListQuery` on `list_files`, `*const BatchListQuery` on `list_batches`).
- fix(e2e/c): emit numeric/boolean comparisons for map-access fields. JSON-extracted leaves (e.g. `results[0].relevance_score`, `data[0].index`) come back as `char*` from `alef_json_get_string`, so `strcmp(p, 0)` / `p > 0.9` previously failed type-check. `render_assertion` now detects the map-access flag on the field and re-routes `equals` / `greater_than` / `less_than` / `greater_than_or_equal` / `less_than_or_equal` through `atof(p)` (numbers) or `strcmp(p, "true"/"false")` (booleans) when the expected value is non-string.
- fix(php-backend): generated `#[php(constructor)]` named constructors now match binding-side field types. Two regressions produced uncompilable PHP for any core type that satisfies `has_serde && has_default && contains_non_optional_Duration && contains_Vec<serde_json::Value>`: (1) `Duration` fields stored as `Option<i64>` in the binding (via the serde-skip-serializing-if-none + `option_duration_on_defaults` interaction) had constructor parameters typed as plain `i64`, breaking the implicit `Self { timeout, … }` init with `expected Option<i64>, found i64`. The fix flips `optional=true` on the `ParamDef` for Duration fields when `has_serde && typ.has_default`. (2) `Vec<serde_json::Value>` fields were treated as constructor parameters, but `Vec<serde_json::Value>` does not implement `FromZval`, so ext-php-rs could not generate marshalling code (`the trait FromZval is not implemented for std::vec::Vec<Value>`). The fix excludes `TypeRef::Vec(TypeRef::Json)` from `field_can_be_param`, so the constructor signature drops the JSON-array parameter entirely and the field initializer falls through to `Default::default()`. Both fixes target `gen_struct_methods_impl` in `alef-backend-php/src/gen_bindings/types.rs`. Affects kreuzcrawl's `BrowserConfig.timeout` / `CrawlConfig.request_timeout` and `MarkdownResult.tables`.

- fix(codegen/binding-to-core): preserve `Option<T>` layer for genuinely-optional fields in the `has_optionalized_duration` builder branch. The branch routed every `field.optional == true` field through `gen_optionalized_field_to_core(..., field_is_ir_optional=true)`, whose body emits `.unwrap_or_default()` for primitives, `String`, `Path`, `Duration`, etc. — producing `T` from a binding `Option<T>` and breaking the assignment to a core `Option<T>` destination. Genuinely-optional fields now fall through to `field_conversion_to_core_cfg(name, ty, true, config)` regardless of `optionalize_defaults`, mirroring the non-builder branch's logic. Both `optionalize_defaults=false` (e.g. PyO3) and `optionalize_defaults=true` (e.g. NAPI) configurations are now correct: in both cases a genuinely-optional core field maps to a single-Option binding field with passthrough conversion. Affected any crate where the parent type has both a non-optional `Duration` (triggering builder mode via `option_duration_on_defaults`) and at least one `Option<T>` field — e.g. kreuzcrawl's `BrowserConfig` (`endpoint`, `wait_selector`, `extra_wait`) and `CrawlConfig` (`max_depth`, `max_pages`, `browser_profile`, `warc_output`).

- fix(pre-commit): prefer pre-installed `alef` binary on PATH (when `--version` matches the pinned `alef.toml` version) before falling back to the cached release tarball download. Speeds up local development (no network round-trip when `cargo install --path crates/alef-cli` already produced a binary) and avoids the "No such file or directory" failure mode when a downstream `.pre-commit-config.yaml` overrode `entry: alef verify` — overrides are no longer needed because the script-language hook itself dispatches to the right binary. Documented in `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` that `entry:` should not be overridden.
- fix(e2e/csharp): emit `?.ToString()?.ToLower()` for enum-typed `equals` assertions instead of `!.Trim()`. `[crates.e2e].fields_enum` entries (e.g. `choices[0].finish_reason`, `status`) resolve to typed C# enums (`FinishReason?`, `BatchStatus?`) in the binding surface, but the C# assertion path unconditionally suffixed `!.Trim()` — a string-only API — yielding `error CS1929: 'FinishReason?' does not contain a definition for 'Trim'` on every chat/batch fixture. `render_assertion` now consults `e2e_config.fields_enum` (resolved through `FieldResolver::resolve` for nested paths like `choices[0].finish_reason`) and bypasses the assertion template for enum equality, emitting `Assert.Equal("stop", result.Choices[0].FinishReason?.ToString()?.ToLower())`. The lowercase comparison matches the JSON form attached via `[JsonPropertyName("stop")]` on each enum variant.
- fix(e2e/csharp): drive `chat_stream` tests via `await foreach` over `IAsyncEnumerable<ChatCompletionChunk>`. The C# binding emits `IAsyncEnumerable<ChatCompletionChunk> ChatStream(req)` (not `Task<T>`), but `render_test_method` previously emitted `var result = await client.ChatStream(req)` — `error CS1061: 'IAsyncEnumerable<ChatCompletionChunk>' does not contain a definition for 'GetAwaiter'`. The new `render_chat_stream_test_method` branch detects `function = "chat_stream"` up front and emits a dedicated body that loops `await foreach (var chunk in client.ChatStream(req))`, building local aggregator vars (`chunks`, `streamContent`, `streamComplete`, plus optional `lastFinishReason` / `toolCallsJson` / `toolCalls0FunctionName` / `totalTokens` resolved from fixture assertions). Pseudo-fields (`chunks`, `stream_content`, `stream_complete`, `no_chunks_after_done`, `finish_reason`, `tool_calls`, `tool_calls[0].function.name`, `usage.total_tokens`) translate to assertions on those locals; `error` fixtures wrap the foreach in `Assert.ThrowsAnyAsync` so the producer is actually consumed. Mirrors the Stage 3 Ruby/C streaming codegen pattern.

### Changed

- feat(e2e/java): emit real test bodies parallel to Python codegen — drop `Assumptions.assumeTrue(false, ...)` stubs. The Java e2e generator now resolves `client_factory` and `options_via` from java overrides (with file-level fallback) and emits real bodies for every non-HTTP fixture. With `client_factory` set, tests instantiate a client via `{ClassName}.{factory}("test-key", mockUrl, null, null, null)` (when fixture has `mock_response`/`http`) or via the env-key-or-skip pattern, then dispatch the call as a method on the client. With `options_via = "from_json"`, json_object args are built via `{OptionsType}.fromJson(jsonString)` instead of the builder expression path. The `if call_overrides.is_none() { assumeTrue(false) }` stub branch in `render_test_method` is removed.

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/csharp): preserve `List<T>` element types and construct `JsonElement` for untagged-union fields. The C# e2e codegen previously emitted `new List<string> { ... }` for every JSON array nested inside an options object initializer, regardless of the property's actual type — so `ChatCompletionRequest.Messages` (typed `List<Message>`) and any `JsonElement?` field (untagged unions like `tool_choice` / `stop` / `EmbeddingRequest.Input`) failed with `CS0029` at compile. The fix adds `options_via = "from_json"` plumbing to the C# codegen (resolved per-call with file-level fallback through `[crates.e2e.call.overrides.csharp]`): when set, the generator emits `JsonSerializer.Deserialize<{OptionsType}>("...", ConfigOptions)!` for `json_object` args, sidestepping per-field type inference entirely. Discriminator fields in nested objects are sorted-first (mirroring the existing handle-config path) so System.Text.Json polymorphic deserialization sees the discriminator before the data fields.
- fix(e2e/elixir): build typed maps with atom keys instead of JSON strings — actually solved by routing default-typed (has_default) struct method params through `Option<String>` JSON in the rustler backend (`gen_nif_method`/`gen_nif_async_method` plus the streaming `_start` post-processor), mirroring the existing free-function pattern. Rustler's `NifMap` derive is strict (`try_decode_field` returns `Err` whenever any keyed atom is absent), so partial Elixir maps like `%{messages: …, model: …}` failed to decode and surfaced as `ArgumentError` at every method call site (148 of 161 e2e tests in liter-llm). The fix accepts `Option<String>` JSON, deserializes via `serde_json::from_str` (so `#[serde(default)]` fills missing fields), and forwards the resulting `core_*` local. The Elixir wrapper layer (`liter_llm.ex`) already typed `req` as `String.t() | nil` so no wrapper change was needed; e2e tests that already emit JSON strings now decode correctly.
- fix(e2e/ruby): drop architectural skip for streaming fixtures, emit `chat_stream` block iteration. The Ruby e2e codegen previously emitted `skip 'Non-HTTP fixture cannot be tested via Net::HTTP'` for every non-HTTP fixture whose assertions referenced pseudo-fields (`chunks`, `stream_content`, `stream_complete`, ...) the public response type does not expose, leaving the entire `streaming_spec.rb` suite pending. The new path detects `function = "chat_stream"` up front, suppresses the Magnus `_async` suffix (the streaming method is `chat_stream`, not `chat_stream_async`), and emits a dedicated test body that drives `client.chat_stream(req) do |chunk| ... end`, building local aggregator vars (`chunks`, `stream_content`, `stream_complete`, plus optional `last_finish_reason`, `tool_calls_json`, `total_tokens`) inside the block. Fixture pseudo-field assertions are translated to expectations on those locals; `error` fixtures assert the call raises.
- fix(e2e/wasm): drop the `WasmTypeUpdate` builder pattern from the WASM e2e codegen and construct the main wasm-bindgen type directly. `alef-backend-wasm` does not emit per-type `*Update` builder classes, so the previous `new WasmChatCompletionRequestUpdate()` + `WasmChatCompletionRequest.fromUpdate(_u)` IIFE blew up at runtime with `WasmChatCompletionRequestUpdate is not a constructor`. Every wasm-bindgen-emitted struct exposes an all-optional positional constructor and per-field setters, so the WASM branch of `ts_builder_expression_inner` now emits `new T()` followed by setter assignments and returns the instance directly. Imports drop the `*Update` value imports as well.
- fix(e2e/wasm): emit BigInt literals for `u64`/`i64` setter assignments and resolve per-call options classes. Previously the codegen wrote plain numeric literals (`_u.maxTokens = 100;`) into wasm-bindgen setters whose Rust types are `u64`/`i64`, which wasm-bindgen now exposes as JS `bigint` — leading to `TypeError: Cannot convert 100 to a BigInt`. The configured `bigint_fields` list under `[e2e.call.overrides.wasm]` was already accepted by the schema but never consumed; `ts_builder_expression_inner` now treats listed field names as bigint sites and emits `100n` (or `BigInt(...)` for non-literal numeric expressions). At the same time, the WASM `options_type` had to be resolved per-fixture instead of globally — every `[e2e.calls.<name>.overrides.wasm].options_type` is now picked up so embeddings tests construct `WasmEmbeddingRequest`, files tests construct `WasmCreateFileRequest`, and so on (the previous global-only resolution forced `WasmChatCompletionRequest` for every call and surfaced as `expected instance of WasmEmbeddingRequest` from wasm-bindgen). `bigint_fields`, `nested_types`, `enum_fields` are similarly merged from the per-call wasm override, with the file-level wasm override as fallback. Imports aggregate every options class referenced across the file's fixtures so a test file covering chat + chat_stream pulls both.
- fix(e2e/wasm): generate `globalSetup.ts` whenever any non-HTTP fixture is present so function-call e2e tests (which interpolate `${process.env.MOCK_SERVER_URL}/fixtures/<id>` into the client base URL) actually find a running mock server. Previously `globalSetup` was conditional on `has_http_fixtures` only; for fixture sets that contain only function-call tests (no raw HTTP fixtures) the mock server never spawned and every test failed at request-builder time with `Unknown Error: builder error` (the wasm-bindgen url builder rejected `undefined/fixtures/...`).
- fix(wasm-backend): evaluate `any(...)`/`all(...)`/`not(...)` cfg gates instead of stripping items whose first listed feature is disabled. `is_gated_behind_disabled_feature` previously parsed only the first `feature = "name"` token in a cfg string, so a type gated `#[cfg(any(feature = "native-http", feature = "wasm-http"))]` was treated as disabled whenever the first feature (`native-http`) was absent — even when the WASM feature set legitimately enabled `wasm-http`. This silently dropped `DefaultClient` (and every method/adapter hung off it) from the generated WASM `lib.rs`. The evaluator now mirrors the alef-cli extractor's existing parser: `feature = "name"`, `any(...)`, `all(...)`, `not(...)`, with whitespace normalisation for proc-macro2 token-stream output.
- fix(e2e/wasm): import the local `wasm-pack` artifact directly instead of rewriting test imports to a non-existent `<pkg>/dist-node` subpath. The post-processor was tailored to a multi-distribution layout (`dist/`, `dist-node/`, `dist-web/`) that alef's own `wasm-pack build` step does not produce — its flat `pkg/` is already a self-initializing CJS module when built with `--target nodejs`. Removing the rewrite lets the generated `import … from "<pkg_name>"` resolve via the package's `main` entry. Projects that still need a multi-distribution layout should configure their pkg `package.json` `exports` map at build time.
- fix(e2e/c): drive streaming tests via FFI iterator handle instead of non-existent `_chunks` / `_stream_content` / `_stream_complete` accessors. The C codegen previously emitted calls to invented per-chunk accessor functions and then comment-skipped every assertion, leaving the C streaming suite uncompilable against the actual FFI surface. The new path detects `function = "chat_stream"` in the client-pattern branch and emits a dedicated test body that calls `{prefix}_default_client_chat_stream_start`, loops over `_next` until null (treating `last_error_code() == 0` as clean end-of-stream, non-zero as error), and aggregates per-chunk data into local variables (`chunks_count`, `stream_content`, `stream_complete`, `last_choices_json`, `total_tokens`). Fixture pseudo-fields (`chunks`, `stream_content`, `stream_complete`, `no_chunks_after_done`, `finish_reason`, `tool_calls`, `tool_calls[0].function.name`, `usage.total_tokens`) are translated to assertions on those locals; `error` fixtures assert that `_chat_stream_start` returned NULL.
- fix(e2e/c): emit byte-buffer out-pointer pattern for `speech` / `file_content` / `transcribe`-bytes-style methods. The C codegen previously treated every client method as returning a `*Response` opaque handle, so methods whose actual FFI shape is `int32_t fn(client, req, uint8_t **out_ptr, uintptr_t *out_len, uintptr_t *out_cap)` (e.g. `literllm_default_client_speech`, `literllm_default_client_file_content`) were emitted with a non-existent `LITERLLMSpeechResponse*` cast plus invented `_audio` / `_content` accessor calls and a `_response_free` invocation. The new branch in `render_test_function` detects `result_is_bytes = true` (resolved from `[e2e.calls.<name>]` or the per-language override) and routes to a dedicated `render_bytes_test_function` that declares the three out-params, calls the FFI method with `&out_ptr, &out_len, &out_cap`, asserts on `status` (`== 0` on success, `!= 0` on expected error) and `out_len > 0` for any `not_empty` / `not_null` field assertion (the field name is a pseudo-field — the buffer itself is the value), and frees with `<prefix>_free_bytes`. The matching `[crates.e2e.calls.{speech,file_content}.overrides.c]` blocks in `liter-llm/alef.toml` flip from `result_type = "..."` to `result_is_bytes = true`.

### Added

- feat(java-backend): emit `DefaultClient` instance methods (chat, embed, moderate, rerank, list_models, image_generate, transcribe, speech, ocr, files API, batches API, responses API, search) over FFI MethodHandles. The Java backend previously emitted only the streaming `chatStream` iterator on opaque handle classes, leaving every other public method missing — Java e2e tests calling `client.chat(req)` failed to compile. `alef-backend-java` now iterates `typ.methods` for every opaque type and emits, for each non-static, non-streaming method, (a) a `MethodHandle` in `NativeLib.java` whose `FunctionDescriptor` prepends `ValueLayout.ADDRESS` (the receiver) to each param's layout (and appends three `ADDRESS` out-pointers + `JAVA_INT` return for `Result<Vec<u8>>` methods like `speech` and `file_content`), and (b) a public instance method on the owning opaque handle class that marshals each `Named` param via the per-type `_from_json` helper, marshals `String`/`Path` params via `arena.allocateFrom`, calls `NativeLib.<PREFIX>_<OWNER>_<METHOD>.invoke(this.handle, …)`, deserializes `Named` returns via the existing `_to_json` helper + Jackson `STREAM_MAPPER`, and frees both response and param pointers. Bytes-result methods unpack the `(out_ptr, out_len, out_cap)` triple and free via `<prefix>_free_bytes`. Null returns or non-zero status routes through the existing `checkLastFfiError` helper to raise the binding's standard exception type. Streaming-adapter method names are excluded from the iteration so they remain handled by the streaming codegen path.
- feat(check-registry): add `pub`, `zig`, and `swift` adapters. `pub` queries pub.dev's `/api/packages/{name}/versions/{version}` endpoint. `zig` and `swift` have no central registry — both delegate to `check_github_release` since they consume packages directly from GitHub release tags (Zig via `zig fetch --save <tarball-url>`; Swift Package Index auto-discovers new tags from Git). Required for kreuzberg's publish workflow which now ships these languages and needs proper existence checks instead of stub jobs.
- feat(magnus-backend): emit `chat_stream` method returning Ruby Enumerator/block-yield. For every `[[crates.adapters]]` entry with `pattern = "streaming"` and `owner_type = <opaque>`, `alef-backend-magnus` now emits (a) a `{PascalName}Iterator` opaque struct wrapping `Arc<tokio::sync::Mutex<Option<BoxStream<…>>>>` plus a private tokio runtime, with `next_chunk` (sync `block_on` over `StreamExt::next`, returns `nil` at end-of-stream) and `each` (yields each chunk to the block, or returns an `Enumerator` via `enumeratorize` when no block is given) inherent methods, and (b) a public instance method on the owning opaque type (e.g. `DefaultClient#chat_stream(req)`) that drives the Rust core stream natively — block on `inner.{core_path}(core_req).await` to materialize the stream, then yield chunks to the caller's block (returning `nil`) or wrap the stream in the iterator type and return it for `Enumerable` consumption (`.to_a`, `.lazy`, `.map`, …). The default `chat_stream_async` stub previously emitted by `gen_opaque_async_instance_method` (which raised `NotImplementedError` because the IR represents `BoxStream` returns as `String`) is suppressed for streaming adapter names. The iterator class is registered with `Enumerable` mixed in via `class.include_module(ruby.module_enumerable())`. `alef-scaffold` now adds `futures = "0.3"` to the magnus crate's `Cargo.toml` whenever a streaming adapter is present.
- feat(csharp-backend): emit `ChatStream` as `IAsyncEnumerable<ChatCompletionChunk>` over FFI chat-stream iterator handle. The C# backend previously filtered every method whose adapter pattern was `Streaming`, leaving the streaming surface unreachable from .NET. With the iterator-handle exports in place (`{prefix}_{owner}_{name}_start` / `_next` / `_free`), `alef-backend-csharp` now emits, for every streaming adapter, three new P/Invoke decls in `NativeMethods.cs` (`{Owner}{Name}Start` / `Next` / `Free`, all `IntPtr`-typed) plus the request `{Request}FromJson` / `Free` and item `{Item}ToJson` / `Free` accessors, and a public `async IAsyncEnumerable<{Item}> {Method}({Request} req, [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)` method on the owning opaque handle class. The body marshals the request via `JsonSerializer` + `_from_json`, drives `_start`, then loops `_next` inside `try`/`finally` (yielding deserialized chunks until null; null + `LastErrorCode() != 0` is rethrown as the binding's exception type, null + `0` is a clean `yield break`), and frees both the stream handle and the request handle in `finally`. The opaque-handle template now pulls in `System.Threading` and `System.Runtime.CompilerServices` whenever a streaming method is emitted.
- feat(java-backend): emit `chatStream` returning `Iterator<ChatCompletionChunk>` over FFI iterator handle. For each `[[crates.adapters]]` entry with `pattern = "streaming"` and `owner_type = <opaque>`, `alef-backend-java` now emits (a) three downcall `MethodHandle`s in `NativeLib.java` for the iterator-handle FFI trio (`_start` / `_next` / `_free`) plus the request `_from_json`/`_free` and the chunk-item `_to_json`/`_free` accessors, and (b) a public instance method on the owning opaque handle class (e.g. `DefaultClient.chatStream(req)`) that marshals the request via Jackson + `_from_json`, drives `_start`, and returns a `java.util.Iterator<Item>` whose `next()`/`hasNext()` pull through `_next`, JSON-deserialize each chunk via the existing per-type `_to_json` / `_free` helpers, and `_free` the stream handle on clean end-of-stream or error. FFI errors (non-zero `last_error_code` after a null `_next` return) are surfaced as the binding's standard exception type wrapped in a `RuntimeException` so the iterator contract is preserved.
- feat(go-backend): emit `ChatStream` method consuming FFI chat-stream iterator handle. The Go backend previously skipped every method whose adapter pattern was `Streaming` because the callback-based FFI export cannot be driven from CGO. With the iterator-handle exports now available (`{prefix}_{owner}_{name}_start` / `_next` / `_free`), `alef-backend-go` emits a dedicated Go method per streaming adapter that returns `(<-chan ItemType, error)`: it marshals the request, calls `_start` to obtain the handle, spawns a goroutine that loops over `_next` (treating null as either clean end-of-stream or stream error), deserializes each chunk via the existing `_to_json` helper, frees the chunk + JSON pointer, sends the typed value on the channel, and `defer`s `_free` on the handle for cleanup.
- feat(rustler-backend): emit `chat_stream` NIF as a pair of standalone `start`/`next` functions backed by a per-adapter handle resource, plus a high-level `Stream.unfold/2` Elixir wrapper. For every `[[crates.adapters]]` entry with `pattern = "streaming"`, `alef-backend-rustler` now emits a `{Owner}{Name}Handle` resource (Tokio runtime + `Mutex<Option<BoxStream>>`), `{owner_lc}_{name}_start` (decodes the request, drives `core_path` once, returns the handle), and `{owner_lc}_{name}_next` (blocks dirty-CPU on a single `stream.next()`, returns chunk JSON or `nil`). The matching `Stream.unfold` wrapper exposes the iterator as an `Enumerable` of decoded chunk maps. The original async method is suppressed in the regular method-iteration loop, native.ex stub list, and main wrapper module to avoid double-emitting a NIF for the same name; the new handle types are registered as resources in `on_load`.
- feat(ffi): emit chat-stream iterator handle for FFI consumers (Go/Ruby/Java/C#/Elixir/C). For every `[[crates.adapters]]` entry with `pattern = "streaming"`, `alef-backend-ffi` now emits three exported C functions alongside the existing callback-based wrapper: `{prefix}_{owner}_{name}_start` (creates an opaque handle wrapping a tokio runtime + `BoxStream`), `{prefix}_{owner}_{name}_next` (advances the stream, returns a heap-allocated chunk or null; null + error-code 0 means clean end, non-zero means error), and `{prefix}_{owner}_{name}_free` (null-safe drop). The opaque handle struct is emitted inline in `lib.rs`; all unsafe blocks carry SAFETY comments.
- feat(e2e): `exclude_categories` filter omits non-binding-surface fixtures from cross-language codegen. Set `exclude_categories = ["cache", "proxy", ...]` under `[crates.e2e]` (or a top-level `[e2e]` block) and every per-language e2e generator skips fixtures whose resolved category matches an entry in the set — no test, no skip directive, no commented body. The fixture files stay on disk and remain available to the consumer's own Rust integration tests, so middleware-only fixtures (cache, proxy, budget, hooks, ...) can keep their existing Rust coverage without polluting bindings whose public API does not expose those layers. The validate pass treats excluded categories as expected-empty and no longer warns about them.
- feat(release-metadata): recognise `dart`, `swift`, `gleam`, `zig`, and `kotlin` as release targets. They join the existing 14 targets in `ALL_RELEASE_TARGETS`, are emitted as `release_dart` / `release_swift` / `release_gleam` / `release_zig` / `release_kotlin` boolean fields in the JSON output, and are accepted by `--targets`. Aliases: `flutter`/`pub` → `dart`, `spm` → `swift`, `kt` → `kotlin`. Required for kreuzberg's publish workflow which now ships these languages.

## [0.15.8] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(pre-commit): resolve pre-commit hook binary in extraction subdirectory. The release tarball top-level entry (e.g. `alef-aarch64-apple-darwin/`) extracts into the version cache directory, placing the binary at `~/.cache/alef-hooks/{version}/{target}/alef`. The hook was previously looking for the binary one level up, resulting in `FileNotFoundError` when executing `alef-verify` or `alef-sync-versions` hooks in downstream projects.

## [0.15.7] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/python): emit positional arguments instead of `kwarg=var` in test call sites. Reverts a regression introduced by 0.15.5 (`fix(e2e/php): spawn mock server when fixtures use mock_response schema`) which inadvertently re-added the `{kwarg_name}={var_name}` form across all branches in `build_args_and_setup`. The kwarg name was sourced from `alef.toml` and did not match the binding's actual pyo3 parameter name, producing `TypeError: ... got an unexpected keyword argument 'request'` for every chat/embed/moderate test. Restores positional emission so the call works regardless of binding-side parameter naming.
- fix(php-backend): map `TypeRef::Bytes` params to PHP `String` and convert to `Vec<u8>` via `into_bytes()` at constructor / call sites (PHP strings are binary-safe). Avoids the missing `FromZval for Vec<u8>` in ext-php-rs that previously surfaced as compile errors on speech / file-content endpoints.
- fix(php-backend): remove unused `gen_php_from_core_to_binding` helper that was added in 0.15.6 but never called; was triggering `dead_code` lint error under `-D warnings` during `cargo publish` verification, blocking the 0.15.6 release at `alef-backend-php`.
- fix(codegen): fix malformed rustdoc list continuation in `ConversionConfig::untagged_data_enum_names` that triggered `doc_lazy_continuation` lint under `-D warnings`.
- fix(napi-backend): add `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` to `gen_opaque_instance_method` (8 params, over the 7-arg limit).
- fix(e2e/python): remove now-unused `kwarg_name` parameter from `emit_handle_arg`, `emit_json_object_arg`, and `emit_bytes_arg`; drop the corresponding `arg_name_map` derivation from `build_args_and_setup`.

## [0.15.6] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/wasm): redirect generated test imports to `<pkg>/dist-node` sub-path so that vitest (Node.js) resolves the self-initialising CJS bundle instead of the bundler-only `dist/` entry that fails without Vite/webpack.
- fix(e2e/c): normalise hyphens to underscores in the `-l` linker flag of generated Makefiles; Rust cdylib output always uses underscores (`libhtml_to_markdown_ffi.dylib`) regardless of the crate name.

## [0.15.5] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(napi-backend): only treat enums as untagged when they have `#[serde(untagged)]`, not just any enum without `#[serde(tag = "...")]` — was misclassifying `VisitResult` and similar externally-tagged enums as untagged, emitting an unusable `serde_json::Value` wrapper instead of a `#[napi(string_enum)]`.
- fix(go-backend): same untagged-enum heuristic fix applied to the Go backend.
- fix(csharp-backend): same untagged-enum heuristic fix applied to the C# complex_enums filter.
- fix(java-backend): same untagged-enum heuristic fix applied to the Java complex_enums filter.
- feat(core/ir): add `serde_untagged: bool` field to `EnumDef` (with `#[serde(default)]`) so backends can correctly distinguish `#[serde(untagged)]` from the default externally-tagged serialization.
- feat(extract): parse `#[serde(untagged)]` attribute on enum definitions and populate `EnumDef::serde_untagged`.

## [0.15.4] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(java-backend): underscore-prefix the unused `package` parameter on
  `gen_sealed_union_deserializer` to satisfy `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings` in the
  publish pipeline (was the v0.15.3 release blocker).
- fix(java-backend): strip tag field before deserializing inner type.
- fix(e2e/c): use `options_type` override for request type when set.
- fix(e2e/wasm): derive bg.wasm filename from the actual crate name.
- fix(e2e/elixir): resolve `field=='input'` to entire fixture input.
- fix(php-backend): emit camelCase parameter names in struct constructor
  field init.

## [0.15.3] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(codegen): silence `dead_code` lint on `gen_magnus_positional_constructor`,
  intentionally retained even though `gen_magnus_kwargs_constructor` always
  delegates to the hash-based form. Without `#[allow(dead_code)]` the publish
  workflow's `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings"` failed `cargo publish`'s package verify
  step and all CLI binary builds, blocking the v0.15.2 release.
- fix(php-backend): pass `opaque_types` to all `field_can_be_param` call sites
  that were missed when the parameter was added.
- fix(php-backend): exclude `Vec<NonOpaqueCustomType>` from constructor params.
- fix(php-backend): emit `Vec<u8>` as slice and `Vec<T>` with manual `FromZval`
  conversion.
- fix(e2e/go): keep mock-server stdin pipe open so it does not exit on EOF.
- fix(e2e/go): honor `fixture.env.api_key_var` for live-API skips.
- fix(e2e/php): bootstrap.php spawns the mock HTTP server when fixtures use
  the `mock_response` schema.

### Added

- feat(e2e/go): support `api_key_var` skip + tweak liter-llm skip lists.

## [0.15.2] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(rustler-backend): remove `{%- raw %}` whitespace strippers from Elixir
  use the `mock_response` schema (in addition to the `http` schema). Switched
  the trigger from `is_http_test()` to `needs_mock_server()` to match the
  Ruby/Python behavior; otherwise `MOCK_SERVER_URL` was unset and reqwest
  failed with "builder error" on every call.
- fix(e2e/go): keep the mock-server stdin pipe open so the server does not
  exit on EOF. Go's `exec.Command` with `Stdin == nil` connects the child
  to /dev/null, so the mock-server (which blocks on `stdin.lock().lines()`)
  exited immediately and every HTTP fixture failed with "error sending
  request for url". Now opens a `StdinPipe` like Python's `stdin=PIPE`.
- fix(e2e/go): honor `fixture.env.api_key_var` by emitting a `t.Skipf` when
  the named env var is unset, and threading the env value as the api_key
  with a nil base_url for live-API fixtures. Previously every `smoke_*`
  live-API fixture failed with "no mock route" because Go always pointed
  at `MOCK_SERVER_URL/fixtures/<id>` regardless of `api_key_var`.

## [0.15.2] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- fix(rustler-backend): remove `{%- raw %}` whitespace strippers from Elixir
  visitor templates that were collapsing pattern-match clauses onto single
  lines. With `trim_blocks` and `lstrip_blocks` enabled in the env, the raw
  blocks were unnecessary and the leading `-` strippers ate the newlines and
  indent that separated `receive do` arms, generating syntactically invalid
  Elixir like `receive do      {:visitor_callback, ...} ->        result =`.
  Affects `elixir_visitor_call.jinja` and the visitor receive loop / apply
  callback case clauses in `elixir_visitor_helper_functions.jinja`.
- fix(e2e/php): treat `field == "input"` as the entire fixture input object
  in PHP arg resolution (mirroring the shared `resolve_field` helper used by
  Python/Ruby/Go). Previously every call whose argument bound the whole input
  (e.g. `chat`, `embed` with `req=input`) generated `client->methodAsync(null)`,
  causing ~99 of 128 PHP e2e errors with "Invalid value given for argument".
- fix(napi-backend): represent `#[serde(untagged)]` data enums as a thin
  `serde_json::Value` wrapper struct with manual `FromNapiValue`/`ToNapiValue`
  impls. Previously the variants were flattened to a `#[napi(string_enum)]`
  and the inner data was lost, so JS callers couldn't pass either side of
  `Single(String)` / `Multiple(Vec<String>)`-style unions.
- fix(napi-backend): map `Json` fields to `serde_json::Value` (relying on
  napi-rs's `serde-json` feature) so JS callers can pass arbitrary
  objects/arrays/scalars instead of having to pre-serialize to a string.
  Threaded a new `json_as_value` flag through `ConversionConfig`.
- fix(napi-backend): per-field `#[serde(rename = "...")]` is now emitted as
  `#[napi(js_name = "...")]` so JS-side property names match the wire format
  (e.g. `tool_type` with rename `"type"` is exposed as `type`). Per-variant
  `#[serde(rename = "...")]` is now emitted as `#[napi(value = "...")]` on
  the corresponding string-enum variant.
- fix(napi-backend): streaming adapter methods (e.g. `chat_stream`) now
  return `Vec<Js{Item}>` directly so JS callers receive a typed array of
  chunks; previously the body called `serde_json::to_string` and the
  IR-declared return type was `String`, forcing JS callers to parse JSON
  manually.
- fix(e2e/typescript): added `result_is_simple` support so that
  bytes-returning methods (e.g. `speech`) can be tested with length-only
  assertions on the result directly, mirroring the Python codegen. Also
  added `api_key_var` env-skip support so live-API smoke tests skip when
  the API key is not set instead of falling through to the mock server.
- fix(e2e/python): client setup is now appended to the test function body
  instead of being written to the outer file buffer; the Jinja migration
  regression placed `client = create_client(...)` lines outside the test
  functions, breaking every mock-driven test.
- fix(e2e/python): use positional args when invoking the binding method
  instead of keyword args (`client.chat(request)` rather than
  `client.chat(request=request)`), since the binding's keyword name may
  differ from the alef.toml-declared call arg name (e.g. core uses `req`
  while the call is named `request`).
- fix(java-backend): wrap `readJsonList` null-check inside try-catch so that
  `checkLastError()`'s `Throwable` is caught and rethrown as `KreuzbergRsException`,
  resolving Java compile error on FFI method calls.
- fix(e2e/gleam): `contains_any` assertion now compiles to OR logic via
  `gleam/list.any` + `string.contains`, instead of N independent
  `string.contains` calls AND-ed together. Adds `gleam/list` to required
  imports for any test using `contains_any`. Without this, fixtures with
  alternative expected substrings (e.g. error-message variants) emitted
  always-false assertions.
- fix(e2e/zig): `setCwd` for test runs, `json_path_expr` skips
  `FormatMetadata` variant-name segments (internally-tagged enum),
  `contains_any` uses OR logic, bytes arg uses `std.Io.Dir.cwd()` /
  `std.testing.io` / `.unlimited` (Zig 0.16 API).
- fix(e2e/swift): `doc_lazy_continuation` now handled correctly in
  field-access codegen; `render_swift_with_optionals` added.
- fix(dart-backend): `#[allow(dead_code)]` on in-progress dart binding
  errors/types/idents; clippy fixes for `gen_rust_crate`.

- fix(rustler-backend): emit `From<Local> for core::Enum` for flat data
  enums when they appear in input position. Flat data enums (data variants
  that are all single-tuple) are encoded as a flat NifStruct on the Elixir
  side; the local→core direction was previously skipped (commented as
  "output-only"). `Vec<Message>` parameters relied on the missing impl,
  producing E0277 "the trait `From<Message>` is not implemented for
  `liter_llm::Message`". Generator dispatches on the discriminator field
  (`role`, `type`, etc.) and threads `.into()` / iter-map for `Vec<Named>`
  payloads.

- fix(rustler-backend): in `gen_rustler_flat_data_enum_from_core`,
  convert `Vec<core::T>` payloads via `_0.into_iter().map(Into::into).collect()`
  rather than the bare `_0.into()`, since `From<Vec<core::T>> for Vec<T>`
  is not blanket-impled.

- fix(go-backend): emit untagged-union Marshal/Unmarshal for enums with no
  `#[serde(tag)]`. Previously the Go backend always assumed a tag field
  named `Type` exists, but only emitted that field when `serde_tag` was
  Some. Untagged enums (`#[serde(untagged)]`, e.g. `ToolChoice`) now get
  marshalers that dispatch on the active variant pointer and unmarshalers
  that try each variant in declaration order. Also avoids the broken
  `&T{}` literal for variants whose payload type is a string alias.

- fix(csharp-backend): handle `Result<bytes::Bytes>` methods on opaque
  handle classes (e.g. `DefaultClient.Speech`). `gen_opaque_method`
  previously fell through to the generic pointer-return path, calling
  `NativeMethods.X(handle, req)` and JSON-deserialising into `byte[]`;
  but the FFI declaration uses out-params (`out IntPtr ptr, out UIntPtr
  len, out UIntPtr cap`). Now emits a dedicated body that pins the
  out-params, copies the bytes, and frees them, throwing a fully
  qualified exception (the wrapper-class `GetLastError` helper is private
  and not visible from sibling classes).

- fix(adapters/php): emit lowerCamelCase parameter names in `async_method`
  PHP body (`call_args_cloned`). PHP signatures camelCase param names via
  `gen_php_function_params`, so the body must reference the camelCased
  identifier. Adapter methods with `String` params (e.g. `file_id` →
  `fileId`) previously emitted `file_id.as_str()` against a parameter
  named `fileId`, producing E0425 "cannot find value `file_id` in this
  scope".

- fix(adapters/node): wrap `bytes::Bytes` adapter return in
  `napi::bindgen_prelude::Buffer::from(b.to_vec())` instead of bare
  `.to_vec()`. The function signature returns `Result<Buffer, Error>`,
  so `Vec<u8>` produced an E0308 type mismatch.

- fix(ffi-backend): convert via `Vec::<u8>::from(val).into_raw_parts()`
  in `bytes_result_match.jinja` so the bytes return path works for both
  `Vec<u8>` and `bytes::Bytes` (and any other type implementing
  `Into<Vec<u8>>`). `bytes::Bytes` does not have `into_raw_parts`.

- fix(csharp-backend): rename tagged-union variant accessor properties from
  `{Pascal}` to `As{Pascal}` in `variant_accessor_property.jinja`. C# 12
  records cannot have a property whose name matches a nested type, so
  emitting both `public sealed record Pdf(string Value) : FormatMetadata`
  and `public string? Pdf => …` produced CS0102 ("type already contains a
  definition for 'Pdf'") for every variant. `AsPdf` is the idiomatic C#
  pattern-matching helper convention and avoids the collision.

- fix(e2e/php): handle `arg_type = "bytes"` in
  `crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/php.rs::build_args_and_setup`. Previously
  bytes args fell through to the default render and passed the raw
  fixture-relative path string to `extractBytesSync()`, which ext-php-rs
  rejected with `Invalid value given for argument content`. Mirror the
  go/python convention: emit a setup line that calls
  `file_get_contents()` to load the file at runtime and binds a local
  variable to the resulting binary string. Inline byte arrays are
  encoded as `\xNN` escape strings.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- fix(rustler-backend): remove 7 orphan template files in
  `crates/alef-backend-rustler/templates/` whose filenames embedded literal newlines and
  template content (residue from the c6856f8c Jinja migration). The clean `*.jinja` files
  with the same logical names were already committed and referenced by `include_str!`,
  but the duplicates were tracked in git. They blocked `cargo publish` (`cannot package
  a filename with a special character`) and Windows builds (`invalid path` on git
  checkout). 0.15.0 published partially as a result; 0.15.1 republishes the affected
  downstream crates (alef-backend-rustler/swift/zig/dart/extendr/java/csharp/kotlin/gleam,
  alef-e2e, alef-readme, alef-scaffold, alef-publish, alef-cli).

## [0.15.0] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- fix(java-backend): drop the `SerializationFeature.WRITE_BYTE_ARRAY_AS_BASE64` configure
  call from `helper_object_mapper.jinja`. Jackson 2.x has no such enum constant — the
  actual `SerializationFeature` enum (verified against `jackson-databind:2.21.0`) does not
  contain it, so any backend that wires this feature in fails to compile with `cannot
  find symbol`. If a future caller really wants to disable base64 byte-array
  serialization the correct path is a custom `JsonSerializer<byte[]>`, not a serialization feature flag.

- fix(php-backend): wrap the `php_visit_result_with_template` `format!` arg in
  `{% raw %}…{% endraw %}` so Jinja stops eating the literal `{` / `}` braces. The
  template wrote `format!("{{{}}}", k)` intending the Rust string `"{...}"`, but minijinja
  parsed `{{{}}}` as an interpolation and rendered `format!("{}", k)` instead. Clippy
  flagged the result with `useless_format` (`-D warnings`).

- fix(java-backend): rebuild `convertWithVisitorInternal` so it actually compiles. Three
  cascading bugs in `gen_convert_with_visitor_internal_method`: (1) the try-with-resources
  parenthesis stayed open across `cHtml` (a `MemorySegment`, not `AutoCloseable`); (2) the
  bridge variable referenced by `bridge.callbacksStruct()` and
  `bridge.rethrowVisitorError()` was never declared in this method — it now lives in the
  resource list as `var bridge = new VisitorBridge(options.visitor())`;
  (3) `ffi_conversion_options_invoke.jinja` hardcoded `defaultJson` as the JSON argument,
  so the `if (options != null)` branch (which allocates `optJson`) emitted
  `…invoke(defaultJson)`. Template now takes a `var_name` context arg.

- fix(scaffold/php): exclude the `stubs/` directory from the emitted
  `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` finder. PHP CS Fixer's `@PHP82Migration` rule promotes
  class-level property declarations into constructor parameters and deletes the explicit
  `public Type $name;` lines. Stub files rely on those declarations for phpstan to know
  what fields native classes expose, so the rewrite silently breaks static analysis.
  Adding `->notPath('stubs')` keeps stubs untouched.

- chore(scaffold/php): rename emitted PHP CS Fixer config from `php-cs-fixer.php` to
  `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php`. The dotted name is the default `php-cs-fixer` looks up
  without `--config`, so users (and the kreuzberg-dev pre-commit `php-cs-fixer` hook)
  pick up the alef-managed config instead of any hand-rolled `php-cs-fixer.php` left
  over from earlier scaffolds.

- fix(error-gen/java): wrap class doc comments in `/** ... */` and stop swallowing the
  newline after the `package …;` declaration. Templates now use `{% if doc -%}` /
  `{% endif -%}` so the package separator is preserved.

- fix(ffi-backend): emit a string literal instead of `format!("include/{header_name}")` in
  the generated `build.rs` go-copy step. Clippy's `useless_format` rewrote the call to
  `"...".to_string()` and broke the alef-verify hash check on every fresh regen.

- fix(ffi-backend): drop `.clone()` on owned named returns. `gen_owned_value_to_c` was
  emitting `Box::into_raw(Box::new(result.clone()))` for any `Named` return, which fails
  for non-Clone opaque handles. New `named_owned` template arm moves the value into the
  Box; `Optional` inner conversions now use `optional_owned` so the inner `val` is owned.

- fix(magnus-backend): suppress redundant `native.rb` re-export when the public Ruby
  module name and the native extension's module name collide. The generated
  `define_singleton_method(m) { Module.public_send(m, ...) }` loop overwrote each native
  function with a self-call and triggered `SystemStackError` on first invocation.

- fix(magnus-backend): exclude thread-unsafe bridge handle types (`VisitorHandle`) from
  binding ↔ core From impls via `ConversionConfig::exclude_types` instead of post-process
  line filtering. The line filter silently failed whenever the alef extractor had already
  stripped the field's `cfg` for an active feature — the IR then carried a `cfg: null`
  field referencing `VisitorHandle`, so codegen emitted `visitor: val.visitor.map(...)`
  lines into both directions of the From impl, and the generated Ruby gem refused to
  compile against a binding `ConversionOptions` struct that (correctly) had no `visitor`
  field. Mirrors the Rustler backend's approach.

### Added

- feat(java-backend): consume the FFI `Result<Vec<u8>>` out-param convention. Java now detects byte-buffer return shapes from IR (`is_bytes_result`), declares the symbol with three trailing `ADDRESS` out-params and a `JAVA_INT` return, allocates `outPtr`/`outLen`/`outCap` slots in a confined `Arena`, checks the return code, copies the bytes via `outPtr.reinterpret(outLen).toArray(JAVA_BYTE)`, and frees them through a bound `{prefix}_free_bytes` method handle. Templates: `bytes_result_call.jinja`, `method_handle_free_bytes.jinja`. Existing Go and C# byte-buffer support unchanged.

### Changed

- refactor(backends): migrate all parameterized code emission in every `alef-backend-*` crate to
  minijinja template `render()` calls. `writeln!(out, "...")` and `push_str(&format!(...))` are no
  longer used for interpolated output in any backend; all variable substitution goes through named
  `.jinja` templates registered in each crate's `template_env.rs`. Static `push_str("literal\n")`
  calls with no interpolation are unchanged. Templates use `trim_blocks = true`,
  `lstrip_blocks = true`, and `keep_trailing_newline = true`. Affected crates: `alef-backend-ffi`,
  `alef-backend-napi`, `alef-backend-pyo3`, `alef-backend-wasm`, `alef-backend-csharp`,
  `alef-backend-java`, `alef-backend-go`, `alef-backend-magnus`, `alef-backend-php`,
  `alef-backend-rustler`, `alef-backend-extendr`, `alef-backend-swift`, `alef-backend-zig`.

### Fixed

- fix(taskfile): make `task set-version` idempotent and tolerant of a leading `v` in the input
  argument. `task set-version -- v0.15.0` previously wrote `version = "v0.15.0"` verbatim into
  `Cargo.toml`/`alef.toml` (rejected by cargo as semver), and the dep-pin regex required strict
  `[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+` so a re-run could not repair its own bad output. The task now strips a
  leading `v`, validates semver shape up front with a clear error, and tolerates an optional `v`
  in the dep-pin and `ALEF_REV` regexes so subsequent runs are self-healing.
- chore(clippy): clear `clippy::if_same_then_else`, `clippy::format_in_format_args`,
  `clippy::dead_code`, `clippy::nonminimal_bool`, and `clippy::collapsible_match` warnings across
  `alef-codegen`, `alef-backend-csharp`, `alef-backend-ffi`, `alef-backend-java`,
  `alef-backend-napi`, and `alef-e2e`. Removes one dead helper in `alef-backend-csharp`
  (`native_call_args`) and one dead method in `alef-backend-ffi` (`vtable_fn_ptr_field`); collapses
  redundant identical `if`/`else` branches in `alef-codegen::config_gen` and
  `alef-backend-java::gen_visitor::files`; drops a never-read `FieldEntry { decl, doc }` struct in
  `alef-backend-java::gen_bindings::types` whose only observed use was `.len()`.
- diagnostics(backend-magnus): add `[ALEF BUG]` / `[ALEF OK]` instrumentation around
  `gen_visitor_bridge` and `gen_trait_bridge` when emitting `impl std::fmt::Debug` for visitor
  bridges. Prints rendered output to stderr when the count diverges from 1, added after a
  duplicate `impl std::fmt::Debug for RbHtmlVisitorBridge` was observed in `html-to-markdown`
  Ruby gem builds (E0119 conflicting trait impl). Test `test_visitor_bridge_debug_not_duplicated`
  extended to 40 visitor methods to better mirror the real `HtmlVisitor` trait surface.
- fix(codegen/config_gen): drop trailing `,` from rendered field assignments in
  `magnus_hash_constructor.jinja` and `rustler_kwargs_constructor.jinja`. The `field.assignment`
  strings already terminate in `,`, so the templates were emitting `,,` and Rust rejected the
  generated kwargs constructors with `expected identifier, found ','`.
- fix(jinja-env): set `keep_trailing_newline` on every backend's minijinja `Environment`. With
  `trim_blocks` + `lstrip_blocks` already on, `keep_trailing_newline=false` (the minijinja default)
  stripped the final `\n` from each rendered template, so the struct/impl builders' `out.push_str`
  concatenations collapsed onto one line. `///` doc comments then swallowed the rest of the file,
  producing "unclosed delimiter" errors throughout `pyo3`, `napi`, `php`, and `wasm` bindings.
  Brings `alef-codegen`, `alef-e2e`, and the `extendr`, `kotlin`, `napi`, `rustler`, `wasm`
  backends in line with the `csharp`/`dart`/`gleam`/`java`/`magnus`/`php`/`pyo3`/`swift`/`zig`
  backends that already set this.
- fix(e2e/java): replace `${{project.basedir}}` with `${project.basedir}` in `pom.xml.jinja`. The
  doubled braces were intended to escape the literal Maven property syntax but Jinja parses the
  inner `{{project.basedir}}` as an undefined-variable expression and refuses to render the
  template. Single braces pass through untouched and the emitted pom still contains the correct
  `${project.basedir}` Maven reference.
- fix(php-backend): align `php_vec_string_refs_let_binding.jinja` to the `param_name` context key
  used by `helpers.rs`. The template referenced an undefined `php_name` and rendered as empty
  string, emitting `let _refs: Vec<&str> = .iter().map(...)` (no receiver) for sanitized
  `Vec<String>`/`Vec<&str>` parameters and breaking compilation of the PHP binding.

## [0.14.36] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- refactor(e2e-codegen): remove all hardcoded `tree-sitter-language-pack` special-cases from production codegen. C, PHP, WASM, and brew backends now derive every project-specific value from config: `ffi_header_name()`, `ffi_lib_name()`, and new `ffi_crate_path()`/`wasm_crate_path()` helpers on `ResolvedCrateConfig` (derived from `[crates.output]` paths). C method-result assertions use generic `{ffi_prefix}_{method}(result_var)` dispatch; PHP uses instance dispatch `$var->method()`; brew converts `method_name` snake_case to kebab-case and calls `{binary_name} {subcommand} "$output"`. A new `return_type = "string"` fixture field opts into heap-allocated `char*` handling in C codegen; the default is primitive value dispatch.
- refactor(streaming-ffi): generalise FFI streaming body generation. `gen_ffi_body` now receives `&ResolvedCrateConfig` and uses `ffi_prefix()` for error-message symbol prefixes instead of the hardcoded `literllm_` string. The request type is no longer hardcoded as `liter_llm::ChatCompletionRequest`; callers must set `request_type = "my_crate::MyRequest"` in the `[[crates.adapters]]` block for any streaming adapter that targets the FFI backend — codegen fails with a clear error if the field is absent.
- refactor(e2e-rust): make visitor trait name config-driven instead of hardcoded. `resolve_visitor_trait` now reads `visitor_trait` from `[e2e.call.overrides.rust]` in `alef.toml` and returns `Option<String>`. Fixtures that declare a `visitor` block without a configured `visitor_trait` now fail at codegen time with a clear error. Callers must add `visitor_trait = "MyTrait"` to their Rust e2e override to keep visitor fixtures working.
- refactor(docs): remove project-specific `html_to_markdown` string from `is_rust_code_fence` heuristic in `alef-docs`. The generic Rust signals (`use `, `unwrap()`, `assert!`, etc.) are sufficient.
- refactor(backend-php, backend-pyo3): replace hardcoded `html_to_markdown_rs` fallback in visitor bridge `core_crate` derivation with a panic that reports the misconfiguration instead of silently using a wrong crate name.

### Added

- feat(php-backend): emit `FromZvalMut` for `Vec<NamedStruct>` parameters so PHP arrays of struct values cross the ext-php-rs boundary correctly.

### Fixed

- fix(ffi-backend): parameterize `core_import` so generated FFI code uses the configured crate name instead of the hardcoded `kreuzberg` string. Also adds `Result<Vec<u8>>` return support via out-params (`out_ptr`, `out_len`, `out_cap`) returning `i32` (-1 = error, 0 = ok), with a companion `{prefix}_free_bytes` deallocator.
- fix(swift-backend): emit `Vec<u8>` / `Path` convenience overloads from the IR shape (first-param `TypeRef::Bytes` / `TypeRef::Path`) instead of matching by hardcoded function names. The backend now derives wrapper names by stripping the `Sync` suffix and works for any library, not just kreuzberg.
- chore(php-backend): fix `clippy::useless_format` warning in test helper.
- fix(napi-backend): initialize all binding-struct fields in tagged-enum `From` and `Default` impls. The previous codegen only emitted the matching variant's slot plus shared fields, leaving the synthesized variant-data fields (e.g. `excel`, `docx`, `html` on `JsFormatMetadata`) unset and producing E0063 ("missing fields"). The struct-literal builders now initialize every variant-data field — `None` for non-matching variants, `Some(...)` only on the active variant. Boxed tuple variants (`FormatMetadata::Html(Box<HtmlMetadata>)`) now deref before calling `.into()` since `From<HtmlMetadata>` is derived for `JsHtmlMetadata`, not `Box<HtmlMetadata>`.
- fix(csharp-backend): emit length parameters for byte slice and batch FFI calls. The C# P/Invoke signatures for `extract_bytes_sync` and related functions were missing `UIntPtr contentLen` and `UIntPtr itemsLen` parameters that the Rust FFI requires, causing host crashes. The codegen now expands `TypeRef::Bytes` parameters into two FFI arguments (pointer + length), and the wrapper methods pass `(UIntPtr)content.Length` when calling the native methods.

## [0.14.35] - 2026-05-08

Re-roll of 0.14.34: the v0.14.34 tag captured an early commit, missing the long fix list
below. Bumped to 0.14.35 to ship them on crates.io.

### Fixed

- fix(napi): emit tagged-enum variant data as optional struct properties instead of getter methods. NAPI-RS does not surface per-variant getters in the generated `.d.ts` types, so consumers calling `result.metadata.format.excel.sheetCount` got `undefined`. The backend now emits each single-tuple Named variant as a top-level `Option<JsXMetadata>` field on the binding struct (e.g. `excel: Option<JsExcelMetadata>`) and the `From<CoreEnum>` impl populates these optional fields per variant, so direct property access works in TypeScript.
- fix(e2e-zig): emit real `extract_bytes_sync` / `extract_file_sync` signatures and mark unused locals. The zig codegen previously emitted calls to `extract_bytes_sync_default` / `extract_file_sync_default` (driven by per-language `function = "..._default"` overrides) — symbols that no Zig binding exposes — and bound `result` / `err` captures with bare `const result = ...` / `catch |err|` patterns that Zig 0.16 rejects with "unused local constant" / "error set is discarded". The codegen now (a) calls the real `extract_bytes_sync` / `extract_file_sync` functions, (b) constructs the required `ExtractionConfig` value via `std.mem.zeroInit(...ExtractionConfig, .{ .output_format = ...OutputFormat{ .plain = {} } })` for the `config` argument (the binding's struct mirror has no JSON-loading helper and the tagged-union `output_format` field rejects `std.mem.zeroes`), (c) serializes non-config `json_object` fixture values into JSON-string literals (Vec/Map params cross the FFI as JSON strings), (d) passes explicit `null` for optional arguments since Zig has no default-argument support, (e) uses `catch { ... }` (no captured `err`) for error-path tests and `_ = result;` to discard unused locals, and (f) emits `_ = try fn(...)` for assertion-free or `not_error`-only tests so `result` never lingers as an unused local.
- fix(e2e-php): fix config argument handling and field naming. Reordered match arms in codegen to check config json_object args BEFORE optional check, ensuring `ExtractionConfig::from_json('{}')` is emitted even when config is marked optional in `alef.toml` — fixes `ArgumentCountError` when no fixture config provided. Additionally, changed config field serialization to use `json_to_php()` (snake_case) instead of `json_to_php_camel_keys()` so Rust's serde field naming conventions are respected (Rust defaults to snake_case via `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]`), fixing unrecognized `output_format` field errors.
- fix(swift-backend): repair extraction wrapper codegen so `Kreuzberg.swift` compiles. The previous `emit_extraction_wrappers()` emitted three constructs that do not exist in the swift-bridge runtime: `RustVec<T>([T])` (the runtime only exposes `init()` + `push(value:)`), `ExtractionConfig()` (no zero-arg initializer is generated; the only init is the 33-parameter `init(ptr:)`/full constructor), and `JSONDecoder().decode(ExtractionConfig.self, ...)` (`ExtractionConfig` is an opaque swift-bridge proxy class, not a `Decodable` Swift struct). The wrappers now build `RustVec<UInt8>` via a `makeByteVec` helper that pushes bytes one at a time, and accept a fully-built `ExtractionConfig` parameter — Swift-side JSON config parsing is dropped because the proxy type cannot be Codable. Batch wrappers (`batchExtractBytes`/`batchExtractFiles`) are no longer emitted because `BatchBytesItem`/`BatchFileItem` are getter-only proxies with no `#[swift_bridge(init)]` constructor and therefore cannot be instantiated from Swift; callers must invoke `RustBridge.batchExtract*Sync` directly.
- fix(sync-versions): self-heal corrupted `gleam.toml` dependency ranges. Earlier alef releases routed `gleam.toml` through the `SEMVER_RE.replace_all` catch-all, rewriting `gleam_stdlib = ">= 0.34.0 and < 2.0.0"` into `>= {workspace_version} and < {workspace_version}` (an empty range gleam refuses to resolve with `error: Dependency resolution failed ... has no versions in the range .`). `sync_versions` now restores the canonical `gleam_stdlib` and `gleeunit` ranges from `template_versions::hex` whenever it touches a `gleam.toml`, so a single `alef sync-versions` heals affected manifests in-place.
- fix(magnus-backend): close enum braces correctly in per-variant accessor emission. The enum template was missing the closing `}` after the variant loop, causing generated enums to have unclosed delimiters and preventing the code from compiling. The enum method registration code that attempted to expose accessor methods as Ruby methods was removed, as Magnus's `method!` macro cannot handle functions returning `Option<T>` with complex types. Accessor functions are still generated in Rust (for internal use) but are no longer registered as Ruby methods.
- fix(java-backend): use `allocateFrom` for byte[] marshalling (JDK 22+ Panama FFM). The generated Java code now calls `arena.allocateFrom(ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE, content)` instead of the removed JDK 21 API `arena.allocateArray(ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE, content)` to copy byte arrays into off-heap arena memory for FFI calls.
- fix(extendr-backend): sanitize error messages to satisfy R's `condition` class constraints. The previous `extendr_api::Error::Other(e.to_string())` propagation produced messages containing `:`, `/`, and `-` characters and unbounded length, which extendr-api rejects when constructing the R-side condition object — the Rust panic propagated through the FFI boundary instead of converting to an R `stop()`. Error messages are now sanitized (`:`, `/`, `-` replaced with `_`, truncated to 255 chars) so `expect_error()`-style tests observe a clean R error.
- fix(java-backend): allocate `byte[]` parameters off-heap via Arena for Panama FFM. The marshal step previously emitted `MemorySegment.ofArray(name)` which only works for on-heap segments and is rejected when the FFI call requires a native (off-heap) segment. Generated code now uses `arena.allocateArray(ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE, name)` so byte arrays are copied into the active arena's off-heap memory before being passed to `extern "C"` functions.
- fix(java-backend): annotate sealed-interface tagged unions with `@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)`. Variants that flatten an inner type's fields onto the JSON object surface produced extra discriminator/payload properties that the sealed interface itself cannot map to record fields, so Jackson's strict default rejected them with `UnrecognizedPropertyException` before dispatching to the variant record. The annotation lets Jackson resolve the discriminator and forward the unknown properties to the matching subtype.
- fix(e2e-php): `chdir` into `test_documents/` so fixture paths resolve from PHPUnit's working directory; supply default `ExtractionConfig::from_json('{}')` for required `config` args missing from fixtures; wrap stringly-typed file-path inputs to `extract_bytes`-shaped calls in `file_get_contents(...)` so the bytes argument actually contains the file's contents instead of the path string.
- fix(swift-backend): emit string/bytes/JSON-config wrapper helpers. `emit_extraction_wrappers()` previously returned without emitting anything, forcing e2e tests to call `RustBridge.extract_*` directly with `RustVec<UInt8>` and pre-parsed `ExtractionConfig`. The backend now emits public Swift `extractBytes`/`extractFile` (sync + async) wrappers that accept `String`/`[UInt8]` content and an optional JSON config string, parse the JSON via `serde_json` on the Rust side, and delegate to the underlying RustBridge calls.
- fix(napi-backend): emit per-variant getters on `#[napi(object)]` tagged-enum structs. `JsFormatMetadata` is emitted as a flat struct with `<tag>_tag: String` plus optional fields per variant, but `#[napi(object)]` on its own does not expose getters that match `result.metadata.format.excel.sheetCount`. Each variant of every tagged enum that maps every non-empty variant to a single Named field now has a `#[napi(getter)]` method on a `#[napi]` impl block: it checks `<tag>_tag`, then deserializes the variant's JSON payload and returns it.
- fix(magnus-backend): emit per-variant accessor methods on tagged-enum classes. The Ruby `FormatMetadata` class was previously emitted with flat optional fields but no per-variant accessors. Each non-empty variant now has a Ruby method (`#excel`, `#docx`, …) that returns the variant payload when the discriminator matches, or `nil` otherwise.
- fix(e2e-gleam): unwrap `Result(_, _)` before field-access assertions. The codegen previously emitted `result.field |> should.equal(...)` even when `result` was a `Result`, failing Gleam's type checker. The codegen now emits `let assert Ok(r) = result` once after the call and uses `r` as the access base for every assertion.
- fix(zig-backend): port to zig 0.16. Replaced `std.fmt.allocPrintZ` (removed in 0.16) with `std.fmt.allocPrintSentinel(allocator, ..., 0)` returning `[:0]u8`, simplified the matching `free` calls, and updated `@typeInfo(E).ErrorSet` to `@typeInfo(E).error_set` (snake_case rename in 0.16).
- fix(scaffold/node): generate proper platform-dispatch `index.js` at `crates/{X}-node/index.js` instead of a single-file stub. Previously the scaffold did not emit this file, so a `napi build` (without `--platform`) stub `module.exports = require("./{X}-node.node");` would persist in the source tree. Per-target CI builds with `napi build --platform --target X` regenerate the file locally on each runner, but only `*.node` artifacts get uploaded — the platform-aware `index.js` is discarded. The committed stub then ships in the npm tarball, even though the bundled binaries are platform-suffixed (`{X}-node.darwin-arm64.node`, `{X}-node.linux-x64-gnu.node`, etc.), so `require("./{X}-node.node")` fails for every consumer at install time. The new generator emits a self-contained dispatcher covering linux x64/arm64 (gnu+musl), darwin x64/arm64, and win32 x64/arm64 (msvc), with a fallback to optional `{packageName}-{platformArchABI}` deps.
- fix(e2e-swift): handle optional string fields in trimming assertions. When a Rust `Option<String>` maps to Swift `String?`, calling `.trimmingCharacters(in:)` directly fails because the method is unavailable on the optional type. Generated assertions now coalesce optional strings with `?? ""` before trimming, enabling fixtures to assert on optional metadata fields like `output_format`.
- fix(rustler-backend): always convert rustler::Binary to owned Vec<u8> in NIF deser to avoid escape-into-spawn lifetime errors. Previously, the `is_ref` branch emitted `let content: &[u8] = content.as_slice();`, which borrows from the input Binary and cannot satisfy the `'static` requirement of `std::thread::spawn`. Always cloning to `Vec<u8>` is correct and the call site re-borrows the slice when the underlying core function takes `&[u8]`.
- fix(e2e-swift): emit RustBridge-qualified function calls in generated tests. Since wrapper functions were disabled in Phase 2D (commit 6bdbd0e9), e2e tests must call `RustBridge.extractFileSync(...)` instead of bare `extractFileSync(...)`. The codegen now qualifies all function calls with the RustBridge module prefix.
- fix(java-backend): suppress checkstyle LineLength on all generated classes. Extended the suppression added for e2e test classes to cover all alef-generated Java classes (records, enums, tagged unions, opaque handles, builders, facades, FFI classes, exception classes, and trait bridges). All classes now emit `@SuppressWarnings("checkstyle:LineLength")` to acknowledge that generated code may exceed the 140-character limit.
- fix(elixir-backend): use rustler::Binary for NIF binary parameters. Rustler 0.37 cannot marshal `Vec<u8>` from Erlang binaries, causing ArgumentError on every NIF call. NIF functions now accept `rustler::Binary` parameters and convert to `Vec<u8>` with `.as_slice()` or `.as_slice().to_vec()` when calling core functions.
- fix(e2e-dart): add missing kreuzberg package import in test files. Generated Dart e2e tests were emitting `KreuzbergBridge.extractBytesSync(...)` calls without importing the kreuzberg package, causing "Undefined name 'KreuzbergBridge'" errors. Test files now include `import 'package:kreuzberg/kreuzberg.dart'` to make the API accessible.
- fix(swift-backend): emit type aliases for all struct types, not just those referenced in enum variants. swift-bridge doesn't reliably expose all referenced types in generated Swift modules, so the backend now unconditionally emits `public typealias StructName = RustBridge.StructName` for all non-trait types. This ensures metadata types (JatsMetadata, EpubMetadata, PstMetadata, etc.) are accessible in Swift code.
- fix(swift-backend): add lightweight wrapper functions for extraction methods. The Swift package now includes public `extractFile`, `extractBytes`, `extractFileSync`, and `extractBytesSync` convenience functions that delegate to RustBridge equivalents, providing idiomatic Swift entry points for e2e tests and common use cases.
- fix(e2e-java): suppress checkstyle LineLength violations on generated test classes. Auto-generated e2e test methods contain byte array literals (for testing error paths) that are unavoidably long; annotate test classes with `@SuppressWarnings("checkstyle:LineLength")` to indicate that these violations are acceptable.
- fix(csharp-backend): remove duplicate accessor properties from discriminated-union sealed records. The code generator was creating both a sealed record type (e.g., `Pdf`) and a property with the same name (`Pdf => ...`), causing CS0102 "already contains a definition" errors. Sealed records don't need these accessors; pattern matching and property access via the record field itself is idiomatic C#.
- fix(e2e-zig): wire kreuzberg module into test build.zig. Each Zig test module now imports the kreuzberg module via `addImport`, resolving `@import("kreuzberg")` failures. The build script also declares ffi_path and ffi_include options for linking kreuzberg_ffi.
- fix(e2e-dart): emit receiver class and arguments in non-HTTP test calls. Dart e2e tests now emit `KreuzbergBridge.extractBytesSync(File(...).readAsBytesSync(), ...)` instead of bare `extractBytesSync()`, with fixture inputs correctly loaded and passed as arguments.
- fix(e2e-dart): convert snake_case function names to camelCase in generated test code. Dart conventions require camelCase method names; the test code generator now converts function names like `extract_bytes_sync` to `extractBytesSync`, matching idiomatic Dart API surface.
- fix(swift-backend): emit native Swift enums with unit variants only instead of typealiasing to non-existent RustBridge enum types. swift-bridge's automatic code generation doesn't reliably expose all enum types; emitting them directly as Swift enums avoids brittle typealias dependencies and enables pattern matching.
- fix(e2e-wasm): inject initSync() call in test files for Node.js test environments. vitest running wasm-pack output requires synchronous initialization of the WASM module using initSync with the bundled binary, preventing `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '__wbindgen_add_to_stack_pointer')` and fetch failures in Node.js.
- fix(csharp-backend): remove stray opening brace after class headers in SafeHandle and wrapper classes. The template already included the brace; the code was pushing an extra one, resulting in all C# generated files having `class Foo {` followed by a stray `{` on the next line. All 30+ C# compilation errors now clear.
- fix(e2e-dart): remove HTTP-only assumption from non-HTTP fixture codegen. Dart e2e tests now render direct-API call tests using `[e2e.call.overrides.dart]` function overrides, eliminating skip-stubs.
- fix(e2e-gleam): remove call-override check for non-HTTP fixtures. Gleam e2e tests now render all non-HTTP fixtures using the default or overridden call config, eliminating skip-stubs.
- fix(e2e-kotlin): fix `build.gradle.kts` dependency declaration. Registry mode now uses correct `groupId:artifactId:version` format; local mode references kreuzberg binding JAR from `target/release/`.
- fix(e2e-swift): document test placement path. Clarified that tests are placed in `packages/swift/Tests/` (not `e2e/swift/`) due to SwiftPM 6.0 limitations, with rationale in comments.
- fix(e2e-zig): implement proper error union and async function handling. Error-path tests now use `catch` syntax; async functions emit informational notes; all test variants (error/no-assertions/success) now compile and run.



## [0.14.33] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **Go module**: emit `#cgo CFLAGS: -I${SRCDIR}/include` (instead of monorepo-relative `-I${SRCDIR}/.../crates/<ffi-crate>/include`), and have the FFI backend's generated `build.rs` copy the cbindgen header into the Go module's `include/` directory at build time. This unblocks downstream consumers that install the Go module via `go get` (where everything outside `packages/go/` is absent). Thanks to @structuredmerge for the report.
- **Note**: 0.14.31 was a tag-only release whose changes never reached crates.io because Cargo.toml wasn't bumped. 0.14.33 carries forward the intended fix.

## [0.14.32] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- feat(release): x86_64-apple-darwin release binaries to support downstream macOS x86_64 CI runners that cannot rely on Rosetta

## [0.14.30] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- fix(java,csharp,magnus,php-backends): set `keep_trailing_newline(true)` on the minijinja `Environment`. Minijinja strips trailing newlines from rendered templates by default, which caused multi-template concatenation in the Java marshalling helpers (`helper_object_mapper.jinja` + `helper_read_json_list.jinja`) to emit `MAPPER = createObjectMapper();    private static <T> readJsonList(...)` smashed onto a single 294-character line. With the trailing newline preserved, helper templates concatenate with proper separators. Also applied defensively to the csharp/magnus/php backends, which use the same template environment idiom.

## [0.14.29] - 2026-05-07

### Changed

- fix(rustler-backend): remove `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` from default rustler_precompiled `targets:` list. The target was declared in the alef-generated `native.ex` but no canonical CI build job produces a windows-gnu NIF (rustler precompiled binaries normally target windows-msvc, and most Elixir projects don't ship windows-gnu artifacts). Including the missing target broke `mix rustler_precompiled.download --all` during release prep, which in turn blocked Hex publish for downstream packages. New default target list is `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`.

### Fixed

- fix(pyo3,wasm,php-backends): add `clippy::arc_with_non_send_sync` to crate-root allow lists. Rust 1.95.0 promoted this lint to default-on; binding crates wrap a non-Send/Sync `ConversionOptionsBuilder` (or similar core type) in `Arc` for ergonomic chaining, which is sound in single-threaded VM contexts. The napi backend already had this allow; the other three now match for consistent behavior on Rust 1.95+.

### Added

- feat(extendr-backend): flat data enums (e.g. `OutputFormat`) now generate a `From<BindingStruct> for CoreEnum` impl in addition to the existing `From<CoreEnum> for BindingStruct`. Previously the binding→core conversion fell back to `Default::default()` for all flat data enum fields, so setting `output_format = "markdown"` on an `ExtractionConfig` was silently discarded and every extraction ran as `Plain`. The reverse impl is only generated for enums where all tuple-variant data types are `String` or `Option<String>` (primitives); complex output-only enums like `FormatMetadata` are excluded.
- feat(extendr-backend): input types (structs that appear as function/method parameters) now emit a `from_json(json: String) -> Result<Self>` static factory method in their `#[extendr]` impl block. The factory deserializes via the core Rust type (which carries `#[serde(default)]` and string-enum aliases), then converts to the binding type. This allows R callers to construct configs from partial JSON (`ExtractionConfig$from_json('{"output_format":"markdown"}')`). The R-side `.Call` wrapper is emitted in `extendr-wrappers.R` automatically. Only input types receive the factory; output-only types (e.g. `Metadata`, `ExtractionResult`) are excluded.

### Changed

- fix(csharp-backend): replace bespoke `FormatMetadataJsonConverter` with .NET 7+ standard `[JsonPolymorphic]` + `[JsonDerivedType]` attributes. The custom converter was removed entirely; JSON deserialization for tagged unions now uses the idiomatic .NET 7+ approach. Generated C# code is simpler and maintains the same runtime behavior.

### Fixed

- fix(java-backend): visitor bridge `invokeCallbacks` methods now split into chunks of 5 callbacks instead of 10. Checkstyle enforces a 150-line `MethodLength` limit; at ~22 lines per callback, chunks of 10 produced ~232-line methods that failed checkstyle. Chunks of 5 produce ~114 lines, safely under the limit.
- fix(java-backend): visitor interface `jinja` template now emits `default` methods with braced bodies on separate lines. Previously the body was on a single line; checkstyle's `DesignForExtension` rule requires overridable `default` methods to have an explicit block body.

### Fixed

- fix(magnus-backend): `version.rb` now emits `VERSION = '...'` with single quotes to match the quote style that `alef sync versions` normalizes to, fixing a persistent `alef verify` staleness false-positive on the Ruby gem version file.
- fix(scaffold/node,php,python): remove `[lints] workspace = true` from the generated Cargo.toml for NAPI-RS, ext-php-rs, and PyO3 binding crates. These crates legitimately use `unsafe` code generated by their proc-macros; inheriting `unsafe_code = "forbid"` from the workspace caused compile errors (`E0453`) that cannot be suppressed by `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` in source when the workspace uses `forbid`. Cargo does not allow mixing `workspace = true` with individual lint overrides in the same section, so workspace lint inheritance is omitted for these crates.

### Added

- feat(e2e-c): added `raw_c_result_type`, `c_free_fn`, and `result_is_option` fields to `CallOverride` for C e2e codegen. When `raw_c_result_type` is set (e.g. `"char*"`, `"int32_t"`, `"uintptr_t"`), the C test generator uses the raw type directly instead of the opaque `{PREFIX}Type*` pattern, emits the correct assertion style per type, and calls the appropriate free function for `char*` returns. This enables e2e tests for all non-process C FFI calls (registry, detection, query, download).

### Fixed

- fix(magnus-backend): `TryConvert` for binding struct types now accepts plain Ruby `Hash` and `String` values via JSON fallback. Previously only already-wrapped typed-data objects were accepted, causing `TypeError: no implicit conversion of Hash into {StructName}` when callers passed a plain hash. The generated impl now tries typed-data unwrap first; on failure it calls `.to_json` (or accepts a String directly) and deserializes via `serde_json`. Symptom: Ruby process/init/configure e2e tests failed with `TypeError: no implicit conversion of Hash into ProcessConfig`.
- fix(magnus-backend): `gen_options_field_bridge_function` now accepts a Ruby `Hash` as the options argument in addition to a visitor object. When the second argument is a `RHash`, the bridge deserializes it as `ConversionOptions` via JSON; otherwise it wraps it as a visitor bridge handle. Previously only the visitor path existed, so passing plain option hashes silently produced default-constructed `ConversionOptions`.
- fix(magnus-backend): visitor method result parsing now detects Ruby `Hash` returns with a `:custom` key (e.g. `{ custom: '--- {text} ---' }`) and extracts the value as `VisitResult::Custom(s)`. Previously `val.to_string()` on a Hash yielded the Ruby inspect string (`{custom: "..."}`) which was then used verbatim as the Custom template, producing garbled output instead of the intended replacement string.
- fix(ruby-e2e-codegen): `count_equals` and `count_min` assertions on named fields (e.g. `field: "warnings"`) now correctly emit `result.warnings.length` even when `result_is_simple = true`. Previously `result_is_simple` caused the field path to be dropped unconditionally, generating `result.length` which raised `NoMethodError` on `ConversionResult`.
- fix(ruby-e2e-codegen): `CallbackAction::CustomTemplate` visitor callbacks now emit Ruby double-quoted strings with `#{param}` interpolation (e.g. `{ custom: "--- #{text} ---" }`) instead of single-quoted literals. Single-quoted Ruby strings do not interpolate `{text}` placeholders, so the template was returned verbatim and the Rust core received a literal `{text}` instead of the substituted value.
- fix(r-e2e-codegen): non-empty `json_object` args (e.g. `options = {"preprocessing": {"remove_forms": false}}`) are now emitted as R `list(...)` expressions rather than defaulting to `NULL`. Previously the codegen collapsed any `is_object()` value to `r_default_for_config_arg()`, so fixture options containing nested structs like `PreprocessingOptions` were silently discarded and tests ran with default options instead.
- fix(r-e2e-codegen): `json_to_r` now converts PascalCase enum strings to snake_case (e.g. `"DoubleEqual"` → `"double_equal"`, `"AtxClosed"` → `"atx_closed"`) instead of plain `.to_lowercase()`. Plain lowercasing produced `"doubleequal"` which the R binding's `parse_highlight_style` rejected; snake_case matches the expected `"double_equal"`.
- fix(r-e2e-codegen): `CallbackAction::CustomTemplate` visitor callbacks now emit `paste0(...)` expressions for R string interpolation (e.g. `list(custom = paste0("[BTN:", text, "]"))`) instead of a plain double-quoted string literal. R has no built-in string interpolation so `"{text}"` in a string literal was passed verbatim to the Rust core instead of the substituted value.
- fix(r-e2e-codegen): `visit_details` callback parameter renamed from `is_open` to `open` to match the R binding's named argument passing (`("open", ...)` in the Pairlist). R's named-argument dispatch raised `unused argument (open = FALSE)` when the function declared `is_open` instead.
- fix(ffi-backend): remove unnecessary parentheses around `*vtable` dereference in visitor bridge constructor. The generated `(*vtable).clone()` caused a clippy `unused_parens` warning; simplified to `*vtable`.
- fix(pyo3-backend): `_coerce_dict_{name}` helper functions now annotate the `value` parameter as `dict[str, Any]` instead of bare `dict`. mypy `--strict` flags bare `dict` as missing type arguments (`type-arg` error).
- fix(c-e2e-codegen): remove unused `failed` counter from generated C test runner `main()`. The counter was declared and initialized to 0 but never incremented (C test failures abort the process), causing cppcheck to flag `failed > 0` as "comparison is always false". Changed return to `return 0;` and updated result printf to hardcode `0 failed`.
- fix(c-e2e-codegen): `not_empty` assertion now guards against NULL before calling `strlen` (e.g. `assert(var != NULL && strlen(var) > 0 && ...)`). Previously `strlen(var)` was emitted without a prior null check; when a `count_min` assertion on the same variable followed with `var != NULL`, cppcheck flagged `[nullPointerRedundantCheck]` — "either the condition is redundant or there is a possible null pointer dereference". Fixed in both the raw-C-result path and the `render_assertion` path (field-based assertions).
- fix(magnus-backend): `MAGNUS_RESERVED_FN_NAMES` no longer includes `"init"`. The generated entry-point function is now `fn ruby_init(ruby: &Ruby)` (not `fn init`), so `"init"` no longer conflicts with generated API function names and API functions named `init` are now emitted correctly.
- fix(codegen/structs): `gen_struct_default_impl` now uses `typed_default` from the IR field definition when generating `Default` impls for binding structs. Previously all non-optional fields fell through to `Default::default()`, emitting `false` for bool fields even when the core's `impl Default` set them to `true`. Now `BoolLiteral`, `IntLiteral`, and `StringLiteral` defaults are reproduced verbatim, fixing `ProcessConfig::default()` returning `structure: false` in Ruby/Python bindings when the core default is `true`.
- fix(pyo3-backend): data enum variant accessor keyword check now correctly uses the snake_case variant name for comparison against `RUST_KEYWORDS` instead of the original CamelCase name. Previously `Struct`, `Enum`, `Type` variants always passed the keyword check (CamelCase != lowercase keyword) and emitted invalid function names like `fn struct` / `fn enum` / `fn type` that failed to compile. Now `"Struct"` → `"struct"` → `fn r#struct`, matching what Python sees as a plain `struct` attribute.
- fix(pyo3-backend): data enum variant accessor methods now use the correct `pyo3::types::PyDict` path (was `pyo3::PyDict`, which does not exist in pyo3 0.28). Return type is `PyResult<Option<pyo3::Py<pyo3::types::PyDict>>>`.
- fix(pyo3-backend): data enum variant accessor methods now call `.downcast_into::<pyo3::types::PyDict>()?` followed by `.unbind()` to obtain an owned `Py<PyDict>`. Previously `.downcast()` returned `&Bound<'_, PyDict>` (a reference into a temporary), which could not be converted to `Py<PyDict>`, causing an `E0277: From<&pyo3::Bound<'_, PyDict>>` compile error.
- fix(pyo3-backend): data enum single-tuple variants whose inner type is a Named binding struct now return the typed struct directly (via `From`) instead of a Python dict. Multi-field or non-Named variants continue to use the JSON-to-dict path.

- feat(pyo3-backend): data enums now emit `#[getter]` accessor properties for each variant. For example, `FormatMetadata` now exposes `excel`, `docx`, `pdf` properties that return `Option<dict>` containing the variant's data fields. Enables ergonomic pattern: `result.metadata.format.excel["sheet_count"]`. Variant names are converted to snake_case for Python idioms; tag field names that are Rust keywords (e.g. `type`) are emitted with `r#` prefix (`fn r#type`) which PyO3 exposes to Python without the `r#`.
- feat(napi-backend): tagged unions now emit `#[napi(getter)]` accessor methods for each variant on the flattened struct. For example, `JsFormatMetadata` now includes `excel()`, `docx()`, `pdf()` getters that return `Option<napi::bindgen_prelude::Object>` containing the variant's field values. Enables ergonomic pattern: `result.metadata.format.excel?.sheetCount` with optional chaining in JavaScript/TypeScript.
- feat(pyo3-backend): data enums with a `serde_tag` field (e.g. `FormatMetadata`) now emit a `#[getter]` for the tag field on the opaque `#[pyclass(frozen)]` wrapper. The getter serializes `self.inner` to JSON and extracts the tag string (e.g. `format.format_type`). If the tag field name is a Rust keyword (e.g. `type`), the function is emitted with an `r#` prefix (`fn r#type`) — PyO3 exposes it to Python without the `r#`. The companion pyi stub is now a `class` with the tag attribute declared, rather than a `TypeAlias`, so type checkers see the attribute.
- feat(r-e2e-codegen): add `result_is_r_list` flag to `CallOverride`. When `true`, the R generator emits the call result directly without wrapping in `jsonlite::fromJSON()`, fixing test failures for bindings (like html-to-markdown's extendr R binding) that already return a native `Robj` list instead of a JSON string. Field-path assertions (`result$content`, etc.) are unaffected — the flag only suppresses the JSON parse wrapper.

### Fixed

- fix(php-backend): config params are now null-coalesced at call sites (`$config ?? new ConfigType()`) only when the config type can be constructed with zero arguments (all fields are optional in the IR). Previously any param whose type name ended with `Config` triggered null-coalescing unconditionally, which caused `new ProcessConfig()` calls in generated PHP facades — invalid because `ProcessConfig` has 8 required constructor fields. The codegen now pre-computes the set of all-optional-field types and restricts the null-coalesce rewrite to members of that set.
- fix(java-backend, csharp-backend): suppress `clippy::too_many_arguments` on `gen_sync_function_method` and `gen_wrapper_function`; both functions require all their parameters to drive code generation and cannot reasonably be refactored below the 7-argument limit without losing clarity.
- fix(extendr-backend): fix overindented doc list items in `gen_extendr_wrappers_r` doc comment.
- fix(e2e-typescript): collapse duplicate `if`/`else if` branches that both pushed `"undefined"` into a single `if` with an `||` condition.
- fix(e2e-typescript): revert vitest `singleFork` config — running all tests in one worker amplifies visitor teardown crashes across unrelated test files; default pool isolation is safer.
- fix(e2e-node): options are now constructed as a plain object literal with a type assertion (`{ key: val } as ConversionOptions`) and imported type-only. The previous `ConversionOptions.fromUpdate(new ConversionOptionsUpdate({...}))` pattern failed at runtime because `ConversionOptions` is a TypeScript interface, not a class.
- fix(e2e-wasm): options are now constructed via empty constructor + setter assignments wrapped in an IIFE (`(() => { const _u = new WasmConversionOptionsUpdate(); _u.key = val; return WasmConversionOptions.fromUpdate(_u); })()`). The previous pattern passed an object literal to a positional constructor (40+ args), silently landing it as `heading_style` and ignoring all intended values.

### Fixed

- fix(extendr-backend): types whose fields include `Vec<Vec<T>>` or `Option<Vec<Vec<T>>>` are now excluded from `#[extendr]` class and function generation. `extendr_api` has no `TryFrom<&Robj>` implementation for nested vectors, so emitting `#[extendr]` on such types produced a compile error (`error[E0277]: the trait bound … is not satisfied`). Affected types (`ExcelSheet`, `OcrTable`, `Table`, `RecognizedTable`) are now skipped from the extendr class list and the derived function list; their struct definitions are preserved so serde serialization still works. Symptom: `kreuzberg-r` failed to compile with `error[E0277]: Option<Vec<Vec<String>>>: extendr_api::TryFrom<&extendr_api::Robj> not satisfied`.
- fix(php-backend): `ConversionOptionsBuilder.visitor()` now uses `Rc<RefCell<PhpHtmlVisitorBridge>>` instead of `Arc<PhpHtmlVisitorBridge>` for the `VisitorHandle` wrapper. `html_to_markdown_rs::visitor::VisitorHandle` is a type alias for `Rc<RefCell<dyn Visitor>>`, which is `!Send`; using `Arc` produced a compile error (`error[E0308]: mismatched types: expected Rc<RefCell<dyn Visitor>>, found Arc<PhpHtmlVisitorBridge>`). Also removed the now-redundant `&` in `Some(&handle)` (Rc is already an owned handle).
- fix(php-backend): `gen_enum_tainted_from_binding_to_core` now accepts a `bridge_type_aliases` set and, for sanitized fields whose type is a bridge alias, emits `(*val.{name}.inner).clone()` instead of `Default::default()`. Previously bridge-type fields in the tainted-enum conversion always fell back to `Default::default()`, so the actual PHP-supplied bridge object was silently discarded — the `ConversionOptions` carrying a non-None `visitor` always produced a `None` visitor when bridging from PHP binding to Rust core.
- fix(php-backend): the null-coalescing eligible set now also includes types that derive `Default` (i.e. `has_default == true`), not just types whose every IR field is `Optional`. Previously, struct types with `bool` fields carrying `#[serde(default = "…")]` (such as `ExtractionConfig`) were excluded from null-coalescing because their `bool` IR fields are not tagged `optional`, even though calling `new ExtractionConfig()` in PHP works fine via `Default`. This caused config parameters to lose their `?T = null` nullable signature and break callers that omit the config.
- fix(php-backend): `ConversionOptionsBuilder.visitor()` method now correctly accepts a `&mut ZendObject` parameter, creates a `PhpHtmlVisitorBridge` from it, wraps it in `Arc::new()`, and passes `Some(&handle)` to the inner builder — instead of ignoring the parameter and always passing `None`. The PHP visitor bridge can now be invoked through the builder API.
- fix(php-e2e-codegen): `CallbackAction::CustomTemplate` placeholder interpolation now converts `{key}` to `{$key}` in PHP double-quoted strings, enabling variable expansion in generated visitor callback templates. Template `"~{text}~"` now generates `return ['custom' => "~{$text}~"];` so PHP's string interpolation evaluates `$text` variables correctly.
- fix(java-backend): builder classes now carry `@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)` so flattened tagged-enum discriminators (e.g., `format_type` from `FormatMetadata` flatten on `Metadata`) and forward-compatible additions don't fail Jackson's strict deserialization. Without this, every Java SmokeTest errored with `UnrecognizedPropertyException: Unrecognized field "format_type" (class dev.kreuzberg.MetadataBuilder)` because Rust core's `#[serde(flatten)] format: Option<FormatMetadata>` puts the tag at the top level of the metadata JSON and Builder + `@JsonTypeInfo` + `@JsonUnwrapped` are mutually incompatible in Jackson.
- fix(go-backend): bytes parameters no longer panic on empty slices. The previous emission `(*C.uint8_t)(unsafe.Pointer(&content[0]))` panics with `index out of range [0] with length 0` when callers pass `[]byte{}`. The codegen now emits a nil-or-pointer guard so `kreuzberg.ExtractBytesSync(nil, ...)` / `kreuzberg.ExtractBytesSync([]byte{}, ...)` reach the FFI layer cleanly and surface the Rust-side validation error instead of crashing the test binary.
- fix(extract/defaults): const-fold integer/float binary arithmetic in `fn default()` bodies. Patterns like `500 * 1024 * 1024`, `1024 * 1024`, and `100 * 1024 * 1024` (used pervasively for byte-size limits) previously fell through `expr_to_default_value` to `DefaultValue::Empty`, so generated bindings emitted `0` instead of the real default. With `<int> OP <int>` and `<float> OP <float>` now folding through `+ - * / % << >> | & ^` (with overflow checks), `SecurityLimits` and similar config types finally surface their actual default-byte-limits to Python/Java/Go/etc., fixing `RuntimeError: Validation error: ZIP archive text content exceeds limit: 3045 bytes (max: 0 bytes)`.
- fix(napi-backend/default-optional): Named function params whose type derives `Default` (e.g. `ExtractionConfig`) are now promoted to `Option<T>` in the binding signature, with the body emitting an `unwrap_or_default()` coercion before the rest of the let-bindings run. JS callers can now omit the slot or pass `undefined` and get a default-constructed value, matching the wasm-bindgen path's serde behaviour. Without this, idiomatic `batchExtractBytesSync(items, undefined)` failed at NAPI's struct deserializer with `TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object`.
- fix(codegen/promoted-optional): promoted-optional Named params (those that are required in the IR but appear after a naturally-optional param, so the binding signature carries `Option<T>`) now emit `unwrap_or_default()` instead of `.expect("'…' is required")` when bridging to core. JS/Python callers idiomatically pass `undefined`/`None` for these slots, which previously triggered a Rust panic that vitest reported as `Error: Panic in async function` / `'config' is required`. Binding types always derive `Default`, so this is a clean drop-in.
- fix(napi-backend): structs containing `Buffer` fields now skip the `Clone` derive (Buffer doesn't impl Clone) and emit a manual `Clone` impl that copies via `to_vec().into()`. Bytes fields are tagged `#[serde(skip)]` so the rest of the struct can still derive Serialize/Deserialize (Buffer's `Default` impl is used to reconstruct on deserialize). Without this, generated `JsBatchBytesItem`/`JsExtractedImage`/etc. fail to compile with `the trait Clone is not implemented for Buffer` and `the trait serde::Serialize is not implemented for Buffer`.
- fix(napi-backend): function return type `TypeRef::Bytes` now wraps the core `Vec<u8>` (or `bytes::Bytes`) result with `.into()` so it converts cleanly into the `napi::bindgen_prelude::Buffer` return type. Free functions like `render_pdf_page_to_png` (`Result<Vec<u8>>`) previously emitted a bare `core_call.map_err(...)` body, producing `expected Result<Buffer, Error>, found Result<Vec<u8>, Error>` at compile time once `Vec<u8>` struct fields started mapping to `Buffer`.
- fix(codegen/bytes-dedup): `binding_to_core` and `core_to_binding` `apply_*_wrapper` helpers now recognise the new `val.{name}.to_vec().into()` and `val.{name}.map(|v| v.to_vec().into())` forms emitted by `TypeRef::Bytes` field-conversions and pass them through unchanged. Without this dedup, `CoreWrapper::Bytes` re-wrapped them, producing `(val.x.to_vec().into()).into()` and `val.x.map(|v| v.to_vec().into()).map(|v| v.to_vec().into())` — which fail with `cannot infer type of the type parameter T` and `cannot find function .into for type T`.

- fix(java-e2e-codegen): nested-record builder methods on primitive-fields types (e.g. `SecurityLimitsBuilder.withMaxContentSize(long)`) now receive the bare numeric literal instead of `Optional.of(1L)`. Earlier the codegen wrapped every numeric in `Optional.of()` unless the camelCase field name matched a hardcoded plain-numeric whitelist; that whitelist missed all SecurityLimits fields, so generated tests failed `javac` with `incompatible types: no instance(s) of type variable(s) T exist so that java.util.Optional<T> conforms to long`.
- fix(go-backend): emit `MarshalJSON` on structs whose fields include `[]byte` (Vec<u8>) so the bytes serialize as a JSON array of integers — matching Rust serde's expected `Vec<u8>` deserializer shape. Go's default `json.Marshal([]byte)` emits a base64 string, which Rust's deserializer rejected with `invalid type: string "SGVsbG8=", expected a sequence`.
- fix(napi-backend): `Vec<u8>` struct fields now emit as `napi::bindgen_prelude::Buffer` rather than the bare `Vec<u8>`. NAPI-rs 3.x treats `Vec<u8>` as a JS `Array`, calling `napi_get_array_length` on the value — which fails with "Failed to get Array length" when the JS side passes a `Buffer` or `Uint8Array` (the canonical byte-payload types). Using `Buffer` accepts both and avoids a copy.
- fix(java-e2e-codegen): enum-typed builder method parameters now receive correctly-typed enum constants (e.g., `withCodeBlockStyle(CodeBlockStyle.Backticks)`) instead of string literals. The codegen now uses a configuration-driven enum field mapping (camelCase field name → enum type name) to determine which string values are enums and emit them as qualified enum constants. Fixture JSON like `"code_block_style": "Backticks"` is now converted to `withCodeBlockStyle(CodeBlockStyle.Backticks)` rather than `withCodeBlockStyle("Backticks")`. The mapping is configurable via `[crates.e2e.call.overrides.java.enum_fields]` in `alef.toml` (e.g., `headingStyle = "HeadingStyle"`, `codeBlockStyle = "CodeBlockStyle"`).
- fix(java-e2e-codegen): numeric Optional fields are no longer incorrectly wrapped in `Optional.of()`. Fields like `list_indent_width` and `wrap_width` that have plain `long` signatures now emit bare numeric literals (e.g., `withWrapWidth(40L)`), while truly optional numeric fields are wrapped (e.g., `withMaxDepth(Optional.of(100L))`). The codegen maintains a whitelist of plain numeric field names and distinguishes between the two cases.
- fix(java-e2e-codegen): nested options types like `PreprocessingOptions` are now correctly imported when used in builder expressions. The codegen now detects nested type usage via a configuration-driven mapping (`[crates.e2e.call.overrides.java.nested_types]` in `alef.toml`, e.g., `preprocessing = "PreprocessingOptions"`) and emits the corresponding import statements, preventing compilation errors when nested options builders are referenced.
- fix(php-e2e-codegen): empty config objects (`{}`) in fixture `input.config` are now passed as `null` to config constructors instead of being serialized and passed to `ExtractionConfig::from_json(json_encode([]))`. Empty objects cause Rust serde deserialization errors when required fields have enum defaults (e.g., `hierarchy_mode` expecting `"unified"` or `"element_based"`). The codegen now detects empty-after-filtering config objects in the `json_object` / `options_type` code paths and directly passes `null` to match the nullable parameter type. Symptom: 10 PHP e2e smoke/format/contract tests failed with `Exception: unknown variant '', expected 'unified' or 'element_based' at line 1 column 397`.
- fix(java-e2e-codegen): typed-record nested config fields (e.g. `SecurityLimits`, `OcrConfig`, `ChunkingConfig`) are now automatically detected and used to instantiate the correct Java record type instead of being referenced as a fictitious `TypeNameOptions` builder. The codegen now includes built-in type mappings for all Kreuzberg config fields (security_limits, chunking, ocr, etc.), allowing users to omit explicit `nested_types` configuration in alef.toml for common cases. Previously unmapped fields like security_limits were reconstructed with a hardcoded `Options` suffix, causing `error: cannot find symbol SecurityLimitsOptions` when compiling e2e tests.
- fix(pyo3-backend): Python API wrapper now correctly excludes data enums (tagged unions like `OutputFormat`) from `_coerce_enum` calls when converting dict inputs to dataclass instances. Data enums are represented as TypedDict unions in Python and should be passed through to the PyO3 constructor as dicts, not looked up as enum class attributes. Additionally, nested has_default struct types (e.g., `SecurityLimits`, `OcrConfig`) in dict inputs are now recursively converted via their respective `_to_rust_*` converters before constructing the dataclass, preventing `TypeError: argument 'field': 'dict' object is not an instance of 'Type'` when callers pass nested dicts instead of constructed instances. Symptom: 3 Python e2e tests failed with `ValueError: unknown OutputFormat value: 'markdown'` and `TypeError: argument 'security_limits': 'dict' object is not an instance of 'SecurityLimits'`.
- fix(csharp-e2e-codegen): typed-record nested config fields (e.g. `SecurityLimits`, `OcrConfig`, `ChunkingConfig`) are now automatically detected and deserialized via `JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T>(...)` instead of being passed as raw JSON strings. The codegen now includes built-in type mappings for all Kreuzberg config fields (security_limits, chunking, ocr, etc.), allowing users to omit explicit `nested_types` configuration in alef.toml for common cases. Previously only explicitly-configured nested_types fields were deserialized, causing `error CS0029: Cannot implicitly convert type 'string' to 'Kreuzberg.SecurityLimits'` for unmapped fields like security_limits.
- fix(java-backend): generated Java source files now comply with the 120-character line-length limit enforced by Checkstyle. Multi-line record fields with long type annotations are now wrapped such that (a) each annotation appears on its own line, and (b) the type and field name are further split if necessary to keep each line ≤120 characters. Trait bridge registry fields (`ConcurrentHashMap<String, {BridgeClass}>`) are now emitted on two lines instead of one when they would exceed 120 characters. Symptom: `mvn package -DskipTests` was failing with 5 Checkstyle [LineLength] violations in generated Java sources (HtmlMetadata.java, PostProcessorBridge.java, JatsMetadata.java, EmbeddingBackendBridge.java, ExtractionResult.java).
- fix(go-backend): Go bindings for `ExtractionResult.tables` now correctly declare the field as `[]Table` instead of `[]string`. The exclude_types list was using unqualified type names (`"Table"`, `"TableCell"`, `"TableRow"`), which incorrectly excluded the public `kreuzberg::types::tables::Table` type. Changed to fully-qualified names (`"kreuzberg::extraction::docx::parser::Table"`, etc.) to exclude only the internal docx parser types, allowing the public table types to be correctly generated in language bindings.
- fix(go-e2e-codegen): pass `file_path` args directly as fixture-relative strings — the e2e/go `TestMain` in `main_test.go` already `os.Chdir`s into the repo-root `test_documents/` directory, so additional `filepath.Abs(filepath.Join("../../test_documents", path))` resolution would land outside the kreuzberg repo. Reverted the earlier path-rewriting attempt and removed the now-unnecessary `path/filepath` import.
- fix(go-e2e-codegen): `bytes` args whose fixture value is a string are now loaded via `os.ReadFile(path)` at test-run time (matching the rust e2e codegen's `std::fs::read` convention) instead of `base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString`. Fixture strings like `"data": "pdf/fake_memo.pdf"` are fixture-relative paths into `test_documents/` (TestMain chdirs there), not base64 — the previous decoder produced garbage bytes that the parser rejected as invalid PDF/DOCX/etc.
- fix(csharp-backend): trait bridge code generation now emits a generic `FfiJsonExtensions.ToFfiJson<T>()` extension method for serializing trait method return values; methods returning named types (enums, records, classes) were generating calls to `.ToFfiJson()` on the result object, but the method was never emitted, causing CS1061 compilation errors. The extension method is now always generated as part of the TraitBridges.cs file.
- fix(elixir-e2e): drop `optional: true` from the generated e2e `mix.exs` rustler dep — `RustlerPrecompiled` falls back to `rustler` only when `force_build: Mix.env() in [:test, :dev]`, but `optional: true` makes mix skip fetching the package, so the build-from-source path used by every e2e run failed with "the dependency is not available, run mix deps.get".
- fix(rust-e2e): `bytes` args resolved as fixture file paths now use `../../test_documents/` (two levels up) — `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` for an e2e test crate is `e2e/<lang>/`, so reaching the repo-root `test_documents/` directory needs two parent steps, not one. Also added explicit `file_path` arg handling so `extract_file*` calls receive an absolute path instead of a fixture-relative string.
- fix(typescript-e2e-codegen): `visit_input` visitor method now declares the first non-context parameter as `input_type` (snake_case) instead of `inputType`, matching the fixture template placeholder `{input_type}`. The previous camelCase name caused a `ReferenceError: input_type is not defined` in template-literal visitor callbacks, crashing the vitest worker.
- fix(r-e2e-codegen): `options` call argument now defaults to `NULL` instead of the non-existent `HtmlOutputConfig$default()`. The `"options" | "html_output"` arm was merged; splitting it makes `"options"` emit `NULL` (R NULL, passed directly) while `"html_output"` retains the class default. Previously all 239 R e2e tests failed with `Error: could not find function "HtmlOutputConfig$default"`.
- fix(r-e2e-codegen): visitor test call no longer emits a duplicate `options` parameter. When a fixture has both a visitor spec and an `options` argument that defaults to `NULL`, the codegen now strips the `options = NULL` from the base argument string before appending `options = list(visitor = visitor)`, preventing the `Error: formal argument "options" matched by multiple actual arguments` R error.
- fix(java-e2e-codegen): generated test files now import only the nested config types (e.g. `PreprocessingOptions`) that are actually referenced in fixture builder expressions, rather than all entries in the `nested_types` defaults map. The previous approach imported product-specific types like `ChunkingConfig` and `OcrConfig` unconditionally, causing `error: cannot find symbol` javac failures in bindings that do not expose those types (e.g. html-to-markdown).
- fix(php-backend): visitor bridge methods now use snake_case method names when calling into the PHP object (e.g. `visit_link` instead of `visitLink`), matching PHP's conventional naming for method names. Previously the bridge called camelCase methods which PHP userland implementations would not define, causing all visitor callbacks to silently fall through to `Continue`.
- fix(php-backend): visitor bridge result parsing now handles PHP array returns `['custom' => 'replacement']` in addition to string returns. Added `php_zval_to_visit_result()` helper that tries `val.string()` first (for `skip`/`continue`/`preserve_html`/custom strings) and then `val.array().get("custom")` (for `['custom' => ...]` returns), using the ext_php_rs 0.15.12 `Zval::array()` and `ZendHashTable::get()` APIs.
- fix(scaffold/node): also emit `packages/<crate>/index.js` (CommonJS shim that re-requires from `crates/<crate>-node/index.js`). Previously only `index.d.ts` was emitted, but `package.json` declares `"main": "index.js"`, so vitest/node failed to resolve the package entry from downstream consumers.
- fix(extract): `extract_serde_rename_all` now properly consumes sibling values inside `serde(...)` and `cfg_attr(..., serde(...))`; previously a leading sibling key (e.g. `tag = "..."` before `rename_all = "..."`) left the parser cursor mid-value, aborting the parse and dropping `rename_all`. Switched the skip path from `let _ = meta.value();` to `let _: syn::Expr = meta.value()?.parse()?;` so the value is actually consumed. Symptom: tagged enums emitted lowercase discriminators (`"listitem"`) instead of `snake_case` (`"list_item"`) in C#/Python/etc. bindings.
- fix(extendr-backend): `generate_public_api` now emits `extendr-wrappers.R` directly from the IR plus a regenerated `NAMESPACE` listing every free function and class env. Previously the package only shipped a `useDynLib` stub, expecting `rextendr::document()` to fill in the wrappers — but rextendr never runs at install time, so every R caller saw `Error: could not find function "extract_file_sync"` (and every other binding). Wrappers cover free functions, static methods, instance methods (with `self` captured by `$.Type` dispatch), and class env definitions for every type registered in `extendr_module!`.
- fix(csharp-e2e-codegen): `JsonElement?` typed fields (discriminated unions like `output_format`) are now wrapped with `JsonDocument.Parse(…).RootElement` instead of emitted as plain string literals; `output_format = "markdown"` now generates `OutputFormat = JsonDocument.Parse("\"markdown\"").RootElement`, avoiding `error CS0029: Cannot implicitly convert type 'string' to 'System.Text.Json.JsonElement?'`.
- fix(rust-e2e-codegen): element types from `json_object` args with `element_type` specified are now imported in the generated test file; batch operations that use `serde_json::from_value::<Vec<{elem}>>()` previously failed to compile with E0425 (cannot find type) because types like `BatchFileItem` and `BatchBytesItem` were not in scope.
- fix(csharp-backend): `JsonOptions` now uses `DefaultIgnoreCondition = WhenWritingNull` instead of `WhenWritingDefault`; bool fields explicitly set to `false` (CLR default) were silently dropped when serializing options to Rust FFI, so e.g. `remove_forms: false` was never sent and Rust fell back to its own default of `true`.
- fix(csharp-backend): generated `VisitResult` record now includes a `ToFfiJson()` method that emits Rust-serde-compatible JSON for visitor return values (`"Continue"`, `"Skip"`, `"PreserveHtml"`, `{"Custom":"…"}`, `{"Error":"…"}`); the previous `JsonSerializer.Serialize` produced `{}` for unit-variant records, which Rust could not deserialize.
- fix(csharp-backend): visitor bridge entry point names now use `to_snake_case()` instead of `to_lowercase()` (e.g. `htm_html_visitor_bridge_new` not `htm_htmlvisitorbridgenew`); the wrong name caused `EntryPointNotFoundException` at runtime.
- fix(csharp-backend): `catch (Exception ex)` → `catch (Exception)` in options-field trait bridges; the `ex` variable was unused in that code path, triggering CS0168 compile error.
- fix(csharp-e2e): options arguments now emitted as idiomatic C# object initializers (`new ConversionOptions { Prop = Value }`) with PascalCase property names instead of `JsonSerializer.Deserialize<ConversionOptions>(json)` calls; the JSON path used camelCase keys that did not match `[JsonPropertyName("snake_case")]` attributes.
- fix(csharp-e2e): add `nested_types` field to `CallOverride`; maps fixture nested-object field names to C# type names so nested structs are generated as `Preprocessing = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<PreprocessingOptions>(…)` rather than inlined JSON.
- fix(cli/build): `cargo` build dispatch no longer collapses to `cd  && cargo build --release` when a language has no explicit `output` path (e.g. Dart in FRB style, whose Rust crate lives at `packages/<lang>/rust/` while generated sources go to `packages/<lang>/lib/src/`). The cargo branch now short-circuits to `cargo build -p <crate-name><crate_suffix>` when `crate_dir` is empty and `BuildConfig::crate_suffix` is set, matching the workspace-member case.
- fix(scaffold/node): generated `kreuzberg-node` `Cargo.toml` now always includes `serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }` and suppresses the `cargo-machete` false positive with `[package.metadata.cargo-machete] ignored = ["serde"]`; machete flagged serde as unused because derive macros reference it via fully-qualified paths not detected by static analysis.
- fix(napi): NAPI type map now emits `Vec<u8>` instead of removed `napi::Buffer` for `TypeRef::Bytes`; `napi::Buffer` was removed in NAPI v3 and JS `Uint8Array` ↔ `Vec<u8>` conversion is now automatic.
- fix(php): `gen_enum_tainted_from_binding_to_core` now emits `#[allow(clippy::useless_conversion)]` before the generated `impl From` block; enum-tainted structs with `Vec<u8>` or `String` fields triggered clippy errors for no-op `.into()` conversions.
- fix(csharp-backend): `ConvertWithVisitor` code path now uses `ConversionResultToJson` + `ConversionResultFree` on the returned handle instead of treating the pointer as a direct JSON string, matching the updated FFI API.
- fix(go-e2e-codegen): visitor test fixtures now correctly emit `opts := &htmd.ConversionOptions{}; opts.Visitor = visitor; result, err := htmd.Convert(html, opts)` instead of an undeclared `options` variable and passing `nil` to Convert. The codegen now creates a fresh `opts` variable with the visitor attached and correctly replaces the trailing `, nil` with `, opts` in the function call.
- fix(java-e2e-codegen): visitor test fixtures now correctly emit `convert(html, new ConversionOptions().withVisitor(visitor))` instead of losing the html argument. The codegen now properly detects and replaces optional arguments when visitor is present.
- fix(java-e2e): generate idiomatic builder expressions instead of MAPPER.readValue for json_object args; e.g., `ProcessConfig.builder().withLanguage("go").withChunkMaxSize(Optional.of(50L)).build()` instead of `MAPPER.readValue("{\"language\":\"go\",\"chunk_max_size\":50}", ProcessConfig.class)`. Builder methods wrap number/boolean values in Optional.of() to match Optional<T> parameter types. Removes MAPPER dependency for options deserialization.
- fix(go-backend): `*C.char` returns now check `if ptr == nil { return nil }` before calling `C.GoString`; previously `C.GoString(nil)` returned `""` and `&v` was returned as a non-nil `*string`, so `Option<String> = None` was misrepresented as a non-nil pointer to an empty string.
- fix(go-backend): `{ffi_prefix}_last_error_context()` is now used in all receiver/param `from_json` error messages; the `kreuzberg_` prefix was hardcoded, causing a CGo "could not determine what C.kreuzberg_last_error_context refers to" build error when the FFI prefix differs.
- fix(java-backend): Java builder classes now derive boolean field defaults from the extracted `impl Default` block (`typed_default`) instead of a hardcoded type-name list; previously `ProcessConfig.structure`, `.imports`, and `.exports` defaulted to `false` in the builder while Rust defaults them to `true`, causing the Java binding to explicitly pass `false` to Rust and suppress all structural analysis.
- fix(java-backend): `createObjectMapper()` now calls `.setPropertyNamingStrategy(PropertyNamingStrategies.SNAKE_CASE)` so Jackson maps snake_case JSON keys (e.g. `total_lines`) to camelCase builder `with`-methods during deserialization.
- fix(java-e2e): `contains` / `contains_all` / `not_contains` assertions on array fields now call `.toString().contains(value)` instead of `List.contains(value)`; `List.contains` uses `equals()` and always returns false when comparing a `String` against complex record types such as `StructureItem`.
- fix(e2e/csharp): config arguments are now generated as typed C# object initializers (`new ProcessConfig { Language = "abl" }`) with PascalCase property names instead of raw `JsonSerializer.Deserialize` calls; this matches the `[JsonPropertyName]`-annotated C# API surface and avoids snake_case key mismatches.

## [0.14.23] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- feat(hooks): add `hooks/alef_hook.py` so consumers can run `alef` as a pre-commit hook without a local Rust toolchain — the hook reads the version from `alef.toml`, downloads, sha-verifies, caches, and execs the matching pre-built `alef` binary for the host platform.

### Changed

- chore(scaffold/rustler): generated Elixir NIF wrappers now use `RustlerPrecompiled` unconditionally with a `force_build:` option pointing at `<APP>_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE` / `Mix.env() in [:test, :dev]`, instead of branching on `if force_build do use Rustler else use RustlerPrecompiled end`. The branching pattern broke `mix compile` in published packages because `RustlerPrecompiled.__using__` cannot be invoked dynamically.
- chore(scaffold/java): generated Checkstyle config tightens line length from 200 → 120, adds `UnusedImports`, and caps `MethodLength` at 150 lines, matching the wider Kreuzberg Java conventions.
- chore(scaffold/php): generated `composer.json` emits a single-escaped `psr-4` namespace (`"Foo\\": "src/"`) and a lowercased package `name`; the previous double-escaped form produced an invalid `composer.json`, and uppercase names violate Composer's name regex.

### Fixed

- fix(csharp-backend): remove public `ConvertWithVisitor` method and embed visitor handling into single `Convert(string html, ConversionOptions? options)` method; `ConversionOptions.Visitor` is now typed as `IHtmlVisitor?` (managed interface) with `[JsonIgnore]` instead of `VisitorHandle?`, achieving full API parity across all language bindings (one convert function per language, visitor passed via options).
- fix(java-backend): mirror the C# visitor fix on the Java FFI class — `convertWithVisitor` is no longer emitted as a parallel public method; the visitor dispatch is folded into the main `convert` body, with the `has_visitor_bridge` flag plumbed through `gen_sync_function_method`.
- fix(rustler): generated Elixir visitor wrappers now pattern-match `{:ok, _}` instead of `:ok` on the `_with_visitor` NIF call; Rustler encodes `Result<(), String>` as `{:ok, {}}`, so the bare `:ok` match always failed at runtime.
- fix(php): `from_binding_skip_types` field added to `ConversionConfig`; the PHP backend populates it with trait bridge type aliases (e.g. `VisitorHandle`) so their fields emit `Default::default()` in the binding→core `From` impl instead of `val.field.map(Into::into)`, which failed to compile because no `From` impl exists for the PHP-side bridge handle.
- fix(e2e/rust): `not_error` assertions on `Result`-returning calls now emit `.expect("should succeed")` so the test actually panics on errors; previously the result was bound to `_` and silently discarded, making the assertion a no-op.
- fix(php-backend): PHP method names now mirror the Rust source name verbatim (camelCased) without an extra `Async` suffix; the suffix was breaking parity with `alef.toml` call overrides.
- fix(e2e/go): byte-array JSON arguments are now base64-encoded for Go `json.Unmarshal` compatibility; previously the raw `[0, 1, 2, …]` integer array failed to unmarshal into `[]byte`.
- fix(e2e/go): `not_error` and `error` assertions are excluded from the "only nil assertions" short-circuit, so a single `not_error` / `error` assertion no longer collapses the entire test body into a no-op.
- fix(e2e/go): `has_deref_value` (which selects `value` vs `result_var` as `effective_result_var`) now also excludes `not_error` / `error` assertions; previously a `not_error + is_empty` fixture emitted a nil check against undefined `value` while `result` was declared-but-unused, causing a compile error.
- fix(e2e/r): `run_tests.R` now resolves script and test directories relative to its own path before changing the working directory to `test_documents/`; also sets `testthat::set_max_fails(Inf)` to surface all failures during triage.
- fix(scaffold/r): R scaffold `Makevars` files now use the Rust crate name (`{core}_r`) for the static library path rather than the R package name; the two differ when the R package uses a custom user-facing name.
- fix(napi): `Vec<u8>` / `Bytes` parameters now emit a `let name: Vec<u8> = name.to_vec();` conversion in the generated function body so JS `Buffer` arguments round-trip through `napi::Buffer` to the Rust core. Adds a dedicated `gen_napi_buffer_conversion_bindings` helper and `is_bytes_param` predicate, and gates `use_let_bindings` on bytes params so the conversion always runs.
- fix(magnus/trait_bridge): `default_types` parameters in bridge functions are now passed as the binding type and converted to the core type via `.into()` (the Magnus binding already accepts the typed value), instead of being typed `Option<String>` / `String` and parsed via `serde_json::from_str`. The JSON-string detour silently dropped non-string fixture values and forced callers to pre-encode every nested struct.
- fix(codegen/config_gen): `gen_magnus_kwargs_constructor` now accepts kwargs as `Option<magnus::RHash>` via `scan_args`, so callers can omit the kwargs hash entirely (matching idiomatic Ruby) instead of always passing an empty `{}`.
- fix(codegen/shared): `constructor_parts_with_renames` no longer double-wraps already-`Optional<T>` fields in another `Option<…>`; previously fields whose IR type is already optional became `Option<Option<T>>` in the generated constructor signature.
- fix(e2e/wasm): `globalThis.process.chdir(testDocumentsDir)` replaces `process.chdir(testDocumentsDir)`; the WASM module exports a `process` function that shadowed the Node.js global `process` object, making `.chdir` unavailable at test setup time.
- fix(e2e/c): C generator now reads `options_type` from the call override (`[e2e.call.overrides.c]`) instead of hardcoding `ConversionOptions`; generated code uses the configured type name (e.g. `ProcessConfig`) for both the `*_from_json` constructor and `*_free` calls.
- fix(e2e/csharp): when a visitor is present but no options argument exists, the generator now emits `new OptionsType { Visitor = visitorVar }` instead of appending the visitor as a bare extra argument.
- fix(csharp-backend): `is_convert_with_visitor` early-return path now emits the closing brace and returns immediately, preventing the method body from falling through into the standard param-setup path.
- fix(hooks): `alef_hook.py` now reads the `alef` version from `alef.toml` at hook-cache root instead of a static `hooks/VERSION` file; the `hooks/VERSION` file is removed. This eliminates version-skew bugs where `Cargo.toml` was bumped without a matching `VERSION` update, causing the hook to download a non-existent release artifact.
- fix(.pre-commit-config.yaml): add `default_stages: [pre-commit]` to prevent hooks without explicit `stages:` from running in the `commit-msg` stage (where they receive the commit message file instead of source files).

## [0.14.22] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/wasm): `inject_wasm_init` now loads the WASM binary via `readFileSync` and passes the buffer directly to `init()`; Node.js `fetch` does not support `file://` URLs, so the previous `await init()` (no arguments) failed with `TypeError: fetch failed`.

## [0.14.21] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/go): remove `needs_json_stringify` from `needs_json` gating — `jsonString()` lives in `helpers_test.go` which has its own `encoding/json` import; individual test files no longer emit a spurious `import "encoding/json"` that the Go compiler rejects as unused.
- fix(e2e/typescript): `json_object` args with array values (e.g. batch items) are no longer cast to the `options_type` — only non-array object args receive the interface cast.
- fix(e2e/typescript): empty-object `json_object` args now emit `{} as OptionsType` (interface cast) instead of `new OptionsType()` (class instantiation); TypeScript options types are interfaces, not classes.
- fix(e2e/csharp): `json_array_to_csharp_list` now handles typed class element types (e.g. `BatchBytesItem`) by emitting `JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T>(json, ConfigOptions)!` per element; previously fell through to `List<string>` which caused a compile error when the C# binding expects `List<T>`.

- fix(e2e/wasm): `inject_wasm_init` now searches backward from `} from "pkg_name"` to locate the correct `import {` block; previously it matched the first `import {` in the file (the vitest import), corrupting the vitest import line.
- fix(pyo3-backend): inject `from_json` staticmethod into the existing `#[pymethods]` block instead of emitting a second one; avoids requiring the `multiple-pymethods` pyo3 feature which is not enabled by default.
- fix(napi-backend): visitor and plugin method calls with N>0 arguments now use `FnArgs::from(tuple)` instead of passing the raw tuple directly; the blanket `JsValuesTupleIntoVec` impl was treating a `(Unknown, Unknown)` tuple as a single NAPI value, causing all extra arguments to arrive as `undefined` in JavaScript callbacks.
- fix(e2e/csharp): `equals` assertions on optional string fields now emit `field!.Trim()` (null-forgiving) instead of `field.Trim()` to suppress CS8602 nullable warnings.
- fix(csharp-backend): typed error classes (e.g. `ErrorException`) now inherit from the library's generic fallback exception class (e.g. `TreeSitterLanguagePackException`) instead of `Exception` directly; `Assert.ThrowsAny<LibException>()` now correctly catches typed errors.
- fix(csharp-backend): `TreeSitterLanguagePackException` (the generic fallback) gains `(string message)` and `(string message, Exception innerException)` constructors so derived error classes can call them without a numeric code.
- fix(e2e/csharp): use `Assert.ThrowsAny<T>()` / `Assert.ThrowsAnyAsync<T>()` instead of exact `Assert.Throws<T>()` for `is_error` assertions; the base exception class now matches derived exception subclasses (e.g. `ErrorException` from `TreeSitterLanguagePackException`).
- fix(e2e/csharp): `contains`, `contains_all`, `not_contains`, and `contains_any` assertions on list fields use `JsonSerializer.Serialize(field)` instead of `field.ToString()`; `List<T>.ToString()` returns the type name rather than the contents.
- fix(e2e/csharp): `result_is_array = true` (simple list results such as `manifest_languages()`) now also serialize via `JsonSerializer.Serialize` for substring assertions, not `result.ToString()`.

## [0.14.20] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- fix(rustler-backend): `gen_nif_async_function` no longer double-appends `_async` when the Rust function name already ends with `_async` (e.g. `embed_texts_async` → NIF was `embed_texts_async_async`); the generated NIF name now matches the Elixir native.ex stub.
- fix(napi-backend): add `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` inner attribute to generated Node.js bindings; NAPI-RS bridge code for trait visitors emits unsafe blocks that were previously rejected by the workspace-level `-D unsafe_code` lint.
- fix(e2e/wasm): `inject_wasm_init` now adds `init` as the **default** export (`import init, { ... }`) instead of a named export (`import { ..., init }`); wasm-pack exports `init` as a default export, so the named-import form produced `TypeError: init is not a function`.
- fix(e2e/go): `contains`, `contains_all`, `not_contains`, and `contains_any` assertions on optional array fields no longer emit `jsonString(*field)` (invalid dereference of a Go slice); Go slices are nil-able value types, so `jsonString(field)` is emitted directly with the nil guard on the field unchanged.
- fix(csharp-backend): `DefaultValue::EnumVariant` for fields whose C# type is `JsonElement` or `JsonElement?` (complex tagged-union enums) now emits `null` instead of `JsonElement.VariantName`, which does not exist in the .NET API.

### Added

- feat(pyo3-backend): generate `from_json(json_str: String) -> PyResult<Self>` staticmethod on all non-opaque struct types with serde and a core→binding `From` conversion. Deserializes via the core type to correctly handle fields with `#[serde(skip)]` (e.g. `Vec<Message>` in `ChatCompletionRequest`). Requires PyO3 ≥ 0.21 (multiple `#[pymethods]` blocks allowed by default).
- feat(e2e/python): add `"from_json"` mode for `options_via`. When set, generates `OptionsType.from_json(json_str)` instead of a dict or kwargs, allowing typed construction from fixture JSON for types that cannot be constructed via kwargs.
- feat(e2e/python): add `from_json_module` field to `CallOverride`. When set alongside `options_via = "from_json"`, the `options_type` is imported from this module (e.g., `liter_llm._internal_bindings`) instead of the main public module, supporting PyO3 native types whose `from_json()` exists on the native class only.
- feat(e2e/python): add `async` field to `CallOverride`. When set, overrides the call-level `async` flag for Python tests only — useful when a binding returns a sync iterator from a call marked async at the call level (e.g., `chat_stream`).
- fix(e2e/python): use `_alef_e2e_text().lower()` for `equals` assertions on enum fields instead of `.strip()`. PyO3 enum values do not have `.strip()` and their string representation may differ in case from the fixture assertion value.

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/python): resolve `options_type` and `options_via` per-fixture from the per-call Python override (`[crates.e2e.calls.X.overrides.python]`), falling back to the file-level global override. Previously only the global override was used, so per-call overrides had no effect.
- fix(csharp-backend): `Optional<String>` return types — FFI returns a raw C string, not JSON-encoded; use `Marshal.PtrToStringUTF8` directly instead of `JsonSerializer.Deserialize`, which failed with raw strings not being valid JSON.
- fix(csharp-backend): `Optional(_)` return types — null pointer means `None` (not found), not an FFI error; generate `return null` instead of `throw GetLastError()` / `throw new ExceptionName(...)` in both top-level methods and opaque type methods.
- fix(java-backend): use `org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable` instead of `org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable` in generated record types; aligns with the JSpecify annotations used elsewhere in the Java bindings.
- fix(magnus-backend): skip `&mut self` methods when registering methods in `gen_module_init`; Magnus's `method!` macro doesn't support mutable receivers, causing a compile error.
- fix(napi-backend): import `async_trait` when trait bridges are configured; the generated bridge code uses `#[async_trait::async_trait]` but the dependency was missing from the generated Cargo.toml.
- fix(php-backend): allow `unsafe_code` in generated PHP bindings; `ext-php-rs` macros expand to unsafe blocks, causing clippy to reject with `-D warnings`.
- fix(e2e/go): move `jsonString` helper into a dedicated `helpers_test.go` file emitted once per package, eliminating duplicate function definition errors when multiple test files needed it.
- fix(e2e/go): `needs_fmt` calculation now checks `field_resolver.is_valid_for_result(field)` to avoid emitting an unused `fmt` import when an assertion references a field that doesn't exist on the result type.
- fix(e2e/python): when a fixture argument is an array of objects and `element_type` is declared, construct typed instances (`ElementType(key=value, ...)`) instead of raw dict literals; matches the binding's type-safe API.
- fix(scaffold/csharp): add `<Compile Include="../src/**/*.cs" />` to the generated `.csproj` so source files from the shared `src/` directory are included in the project build.
- fix(scaffold/node): add `async-trait = "0.1"` to Node.js Cargo.toml scaffold when trait bridges are configured; the generated bridge code uses `#[async_trait::async_trait]` but the dependency was missing.
- fix(rustler-backend): declare `visitor_owned_env` as `mut` so `send_and_clear` (which takes `&mut self`) compiles without E0596 borrow error.
- fix(php-backend): use `!is_php_prop_scalar_with_enums` instead of `type_ref_has_named` when computing `has_named_params` in struct methods codegen, correctly gating named-param constructors on non-scalar fields.
- fix(pyo3-backend): correct boolean logic in `is_native` computation in `gen_api_py` — options types are now excluded first, then native membership is checked, preventing options types from incorrectly landing in native imports.
- fix(rustler-backend): replace double-nested `OwnedEnv::run` + `send_and_clear` with a single `send_and_clear` call in the trait bridge field function spawn closure, eliminating a double-borrow that caused BEAM message delivery failures.
- fix(e2e/wasm): remove `vite-plugin-top-level-await` from generated WASM e2e `package.json` and vitest config; top-level await is natively supported in modern Vite/Vitest without the plugin.
- fix(napi-backend): force `is_param_optional = true` in bridge functions so options parameters are always treated as `Option<T>` regardless of whether the IR marks them as non-optional.
- fix(php-backend): add `#[serde(default)]` struct attribute when `has_serde` is enabled, so `from_json()` accepts partial JSON and missing fields use `Default` values instead of failing deserialization.
- fix(php-backend): always emit `from_json` for has_default structs when `has_serde` is true, preventing broken `__construct` methods with invalid Rust enum defaults (e.g. `BrowserMode::Auto`) that don't exist in the PHP binding's string-mapped enum model.
- fix(e2e/go): `is_empty` assertions on pointer-to-struct results now generate `if result != nil { ... }` instead of dereferencing and calling `len()` on a struct, which was both invalid and panicked on nil.
- fix(csharp-backend): add `using System.Collections.Generic;` to generated opaque type source files when any method has a `Vec<T>` parameter or return type.
- fix(csharp-backend): pass full set of opaque type names to `gen_opaque_handle` so that methods on one opaque type returning another opaque type (e.g. `LanguageRegistry::get_language` → `Language`) wrap the pointer with `new Language(ptr)` instead of incorrectly calling the non-existent `LanguageToJson` FFI.

## [0.14.19] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- fix(scaffold/python): add `async-trait` dependency to Python Cargo.toml scaffold when trait bridges are configured.
- fix(scaffold/php): add `async-trait` dependency to PHP Cargo.toml scaffold when trait bridges are configured.
- fix(e2e/c): derive header name from `ffi.header_name` config and lib name from `ffi.lib_name` when package-level overrides are absent.
- fix(e2e/go): fix array-assertion detection to correctly check `result_is_array` when no field is specified, without falling through to field-level `is_array` check.
- fix(e2e/ruby): call `.to_s` before `.strip` on simple result fields; call `.to_s` before `not_to be_empty` for simple result fields.

## [0.14.18] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- fix(scaffold/ffi): add `async-trait` dependency to FFI Cargo.toml scaffold when trait bridges are configured. When the config has trait bridges, the generated FFI `lib.rs` uses `#[async_trait::async_trait]` for trait bridge implementations, but the dependency was missing from the generated Cargo.toml, causing compilation errors.

## [0.14.17] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- fix(scaffold/rustler): remove unused `futures-util` dependency from Rustler NIF Cargo.toml scaffold. When `has_async=true`, the dependency was added speculatively but the generated Rustler code never imports it, causing `cargo-machete` to flag it as unused.

## [0.14.16] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- fix(scaffold): `alef all --clean` now force-regenerates scaffold files (Cargo.toml templates, gemspec, etc.) matching the behaviour of README and e2e file writes. Previously scaffold files were never overwritten by `--clean`, leaving stale content (e.g. removed `[lints]` section) on disk indefinitely.

- fix(scaffold/php): downgrade `ext-php-rs` template version from `0.15.12` back to `0.15.4`. Version 0.15.12 introduced an `ext-php-rs-clang-sys` fork that conflicts with `clang-sys` when `kreuzberg-php` is a member of a shared Cargo workspace.

- fix(pyo3): coerce enum fields in dict input before constructing dataclass. When a config dict (e.g. `ExtractionConfig`) contains an enum-typed field, the dict→dataclass path now converts the string value to the correct Python enum member before calling `DataClass(**value)`.

- fix(rustler): extend visitor callback return handler to recognise all `CallbackAction` variants. Previously only `is_binary(result)` was checked; `:continue`, `:skip`, `:preserve_html`, and `{:custom, value}` tuples are now handled correctly.

- fix(e2e/csharp): normalise enum field values to lowercase before serialising fixture input JSON. C# `JsonStringEnumConverter` emits lowercase names; passing PascalCase values (e.g. `"Tildes"`) from fixtures caused deserialization mismatches.

- fix(e2e/elixir): include fixtures that use `client_factory` override when computing `has_mock_server_tests` in the test module header. Previously only fixtures that called `needs_mock_server()` were counted, causing the mock server setup to be omitted for client-factory fixtures.

- fix(e2e/python): include fixtures that use a `client_factory` Python override when computing `has_http_fixtures` in `conftest.py`. Same root cause as the Elixir fix above.

## [0.14.15] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/go-codegen): exclude mock-only fixtures from `needs_pkg` import check. Mock fixtures with no real function calls were incorrectly triggering conditional imports.

- fix(e2e/ruby-scaffold): remove `[lints] workspace = true` from excluded-workspace Magnus Cargo.toml. The lints section is inherited from workspace config, but packages/ruby/ext/kreuzberg_rb/ is excluded from the workspace, so `workspace = true` failed with "cannot find workspace root". Removed the lints section from the generated Cargo.toml template.

- fix(e2e/php-codegen): strip namespace prefix from class names in use statements. When class override contains a namespace (e.g. `Kreuzberg\Kreuzberg`), extract just the class name to avoid triple-nested namespaces like `use Kreuzberg\Kreuzberg\Kreuzberg;`. Now correctly emits `use Kreuzberg\Kreuzberg;`.

## [0.14.14] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- fix(java-backend): `Duration` fields map to boxed `Long` in Java; compact constructor defaults emitted as bare integer literals (e.g. `30000`) failed to compile because `int` does not auto-box to `Long`. Now appends `L` suffix so the literal is a `long` that Java auto-boxes correctly.

- fix(magnus-backend): emit a `_refs: Vec<&str>` intermediate binding when a `Vec<String>` parameter is passed by reference to a core function expecting `&[&str]`. Previously the generated code passed `&Vec<String>` directly, which mismatches the `&[&str]` signature and fails to compile.

- fix(rustler-backend): same `Vec<String>` → `&[&str]` refs intermediate for Rustler/Elixir bindings (mirrors the Magnus fix above).

- fix(napi-backend): use `.into()` (`FnArgs`) when calling visitor JS callbacks with more than one argument. Single-argument calls are unaffected; multi-argument calls previously passed a raw tuple that NAPI-RS did not unpack correctly to JavaScript.

- fix(cache): include alef binary identity (mtime + size) in `compute_lang_hash` and `compute_stage_hash` so locally rebuilt binaries always invalidate stale caches without requiring a version bump. Previously a rebuild with code changes would reuse the old cached output.

- fix(e2e-elixir): rewrite `alef_e2e_item_texts` helper to use `Enum.flat_map` with a `case` expression instead of `Enum.map(fn attr -> item |> Map.get(attr) |> to_string() end)`. `to_string/1` raises `ArgumentError` on atom values (e.g. enum variants); the new form guards `is_atom` and capitalises separately.

- fix(e2e-go): use `len(slice)` instead of `len(*slice)` for optional slice-typed fields in `not_empty`, `empty`, `min_elements`, and `max_elements` assertions. Go slice optionals are value types, not pointer-to-slice, so dereferencing them was a compile error.

- fix(e2e-typescript): convert `{placeholder}` syntax to `${placeholder}` in `CustomTemplate` visitor method bodies so the emitted string is a valid JavaScript template literal.

- fix(e2e-go): include fmt import when `needs_json_stringify` is true, since the `jsonString` helper uses `fmt.Sprint`. Previously tests with array field `contains` assertions failed to compile with "undefined: fmt".

- fix(e2e-csharp): add missing `using static {namespace}.{class_name};` directive to test file headers so static method calls to the binding class resolve without full qualification.

- fix(e2e-java): add `org.jetbrains:annotations:24.1.0` dependency to generated pom.xml. E2e tests use `@NotNull`/`@Nullable` annotations from this package.

- fix(e2e-elixir): skip batch functions in generated tests with `@tag :skip`. Batch functions (`batch_extract_*`) are excluded from the Elixir binding due to unsafe NIF tuple marshalling; tests now emit a documented skip rather than failing to compile.

## [0.14.13] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- fix(e2e-go): propagate call-level `result_is_array` to Go generator. Previously only Go-specific overrides were checked, so call-level `result_is_array = true` was ignored, causing `value := *result` dereference errors for slice return types like `[]string`.

## [0.14.12] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- fix(pyo3): use `val.kind.into()` instead of `Default::default()` for data enum fields in `From` impls. Data enums (like `StructureKind`) were added to `opaque_names_set` which caused the conversion generator to treat their fields as opaque and emit `Default::default()`. A separate `conversion_opaque_set` now excludes data enum names so their fields convert correctly with `.into()`.

- fix(e2e-ruby): use per-item text check for array field `contains` assertions. Previously `result.structure.to_s` produced an object-repr string that never matched the expected value. Now generates `array.any? { |item| alef_e2e_item_texts(item).any? { |t| t.include?(val) } }` using a shared helper method.

- fix(e2e-elixir): use `Enum.any?` for array field `contains` assertions instead of `to_string` on list. `to_string/1` on an Elixir list raises `ArgumentError`; now generates a per-item traversal using a shared `alef_e2e_item_texts/1` helper.

- fix(e2e-go): skip nil check and pointer dereference for `result_is_array` slice results. Go slice types (`[]string`) are not pointers, so the generated `if result == nil` check and `value := *result` dereference were compile errors. Array results now use `value := result` directly.

- fix(magnus-backend): add `options_field` visitor bridge support. The Magnus Ruby backend now generates proper wrapper functions for trait bridges using `bind_via = "options_field"` binding style. Previously only `bind_via = "function_param"` was supported, causing e2e tests to fail when trying to pass a visitor as a secondary argument to functions like `convert(html, visitor)`.

## [0.14.11] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- fix(e2e-python): fix `_to_rust_*()` converter field access when `python_output = "typed-dict"`. Previously the converter used `value.get("field")` dict-style access even for dataclass input types, causing `AttributeError` when called with `ProcessConfig` instances. Converters now use `value.field` attribute access (matching the input style) rather than the output style.

- fix(e2e-go): propagate `call_config.result_is_simple` to Go e2e generator. The generator was only checking per-language overrides, so call-level `result_is_simple = true` was ignored, causing `*string` returns to be treated as `error` and printing pointer addresses as failure messages.

- fix(e2e-php): add `options_type` support for PHP. When a call override sets `options_type = "ClassName"`, PHP e2e tests now generate `ClassName::from_json(json_encode([...]))` to construct typed config objects. Removes hardcoded `\HtmlToMarkdown\ConversionOptions::builder()` placeholder.

- fix(e2e-elixir): fix 0-arity functions (e.g. `language_count`, `available_languages`) called with `%{}` or `nil` when `args = []` and fixture input is empty. Now correctly emits no-arg calls.

- fix(e2e-ruby): same empty-args fix for Ruby — 0-arity functions no longer receive `nil` or `{}` from empty fixtures.

- fix(csharp-backend): store delegate objects in field array to prevent GC collection. The trait bridge generated code was creating 41+ `UnmanagedFunctionPointer` delegates as local variables in `BuildVtable()`, then immediately discarding them. The GC could collect these delegates, leaving dangling function pointers in the vtable and causing `AccessViolationException` on native callbacks. Now delegates are stored in `private readonly object[] _delegates` initialized in the constructor and kept alive for the bridge's lifetime.

## [0.14.10] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- feat(e2e-go): `client_factory` support in Go e2e codegen. When `[e2e.call.overrides.go] client_factory = "CreateClient"` is set, the generated test creates a client via `pkg.CreateClient("test-key", baseURL)` and calls API methods as `client.Method(args)` instead of `pkg.Function(args)`. Also fixes `fixture_has_go_callable` to return `true` when `client_factory` is configured.

- feat(e2e-python): `client_factory` support in Python e2e codegen. When `[e2e.call.overrides.python] client_factory = "create_client"` is set, the generated test imports only the factory function, creates a client, and dispatches calls as `client.method(args)`.

- feat(e2e-csharp): `client_factory` support in C# e2e codegen. When `[e2e.call.overrides.csharp] client_factory = "createClient"` is set, the generated test calls `ClassName.CreateClient("test-key", baseUrl)` and dispatches as `client.Method(args)`.

- feat(e2e-ruby): `client_factory` support in Ruby e2e codegen. When `[e2e.call.overrides.ruby] client_factory = "create_client"` is set, the generated spec creates a client via `ModuleName.create_client('test-key', ENV.fetch('MOCK_SERVER_URL'))` and calls methods on it.

- feat(e2e-elixir): `client_factory` support in Elixir e2e codegen. When `[e2e.call.overrides.elixir] client_factory = "create_client"` is set, the generated test calls `{:ok, client} = ModuleName.create_client("test-key", base_url)` and passes `client` as the first argument to API functions.

### Fixed

- fix(e2e): include fixture id in mock server base URL for C#/Ruby/Elixir e2e backends. Previously `client_factory` generated code pointed clients at bare `MOCK_SERVER_URL`; now appends `/fixtures/{fixture_id}` so API calls route correctly through the mock server's prefix-based routing.

- fix(e2e-php): parametrize extension name in generated `run_tests.php`; previously hardcoded to `libhtml_to_markdown_php`, now derived from the crate's extension name so generated test runners work across projects.

- fix(e2e-wasm): inject `initSync` initialization block in generated test files for Node.js environments. Uses `fs.readFileSync` + `initSync` to load the WASM binary from the local `node_modules` path, replacing the broken async fetch-based approach that fails in vitest's Node.js runner.

- fix(e2e): remove language suffix from generated e2e package names. TypeScript packages now use `{pkg}-e2e` instead of `{pkg}-e2e-typescript`; Python packages use `{pkg}-e2e` instead of `{pkg}-e2e-tests`. Python `pkg_name` now defaults to the call module name (replacing a stale hard-coded project name).

- fix(e2e-wasm): remove `initWasm()` call from generated test files. The bundler target auto-initializes when imported, so explicit initialization is unnecessary and causes `TypeError: initWasm is not a function`.

- fix(backend-java): use `LINKER.defaultLookup()` for Panama FFM symbol resolution. The `SymbolLookup.loaderLookup()` API returns symbols from Java's class loader, not the native linker; `LINKER.defaultLookup()` correctly returns symbols from all loaded native libraries.

## [0.14.9] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- fix(backend-pyo3): `_coerce_enum` helper now returns `_E` (not `_E | None`) by separating
  the `isinstance` early-return from the `None` case (which now raises `ValueError`). This
  eliminates the `[return-value]` mypy error and removes now-unused `# type: ignore` comments
  that newer mypy versions flag as `[unused-ignore]`.

- fix(backend-napi): `find_options_field_binding` now unwraps Optional types when matching
  options parameters against `options_type` in trait bridge configs. When a function parameter
  is `Option<ConversionOptions>` and a trait bridge specifies `bind_via = "options_field"`,
  the NAPI backend now correctly recognizes the parameter and generates the visitor bridge code.
  Fixes 45 failing Node.js visitor e2e tests where `options.visitor` was being discarded by
  the generated From impl.

- fix(e2e-php): emit `ConversionOptions::from_json()` instead of direct property assignment,
  since ext-php-rs doesn't support writable #[php(prop)] fields; fixes "No setter available for
  this property" errors in 7 e2e tests with preprocessing/metadata options

- fix(backend-go): initialize string-alias enum zero values as `EnumType("")` instead of `EnumType{}` (composite literal syntax only applies to structs/slices/maps, not string aliases)

- fix(backend-go): option setter functions for slice and map fields now assign `v` directly instead of `&v`, matching the `[]T` field types introduced in v0.14.5

- fix(backend-pyo3): fix `_coerce_enum` return type from `_E` to `_E | None` to allow None values
  in optional enum fields; remove unnecessary type: ignore comments that mypy flags as unused

- fix(backend-java): use short annotation names (`@JsonDeserialize`, `@JsonPOJOBuilder`) instead of
  fully-qualified names in generated record and builder classes so that the accompanying import
  statements are actually used and checkstyle's UnusedImports rule passes.

- fix(codegen): `gen_lossy_binding_to_core_fields` and `gen_lossy_binding_to_core_fields_mut` now
  accept `cast_uints_to_i32` and `cast_large_ints_to_f64` flags. All callers updated (magnus,
  integration tests). Extendr backend passes `true` for both to correctly cast R's i32/f64 types
  back to core Rust int types in generated method bodies.

- fix(e2e-php): do not append `_async` suffix to function name when a language-specific override
  explicitly provides the function name. Previously, async PHP functions with overridden names
  were incorrectly suffixed with `_async`.

## [0.14.8] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- fix(backend-ffi): `type_ref_to_rust_type` now prefixes named types with `kreuzberg::` so
  `Vec<BatchFileItem>` turbofish annotations in FFI bodies are emitted as
  `Vec<kreuzberg::BatchFileItem>`. The v0.14.6 fix added turbofish annotations without the
  crate prefix, causing "cannot find type X in this scope" E0425 errors in the FFI crate for
  all `Vec<T>`-parameter functions whose element type is a core library struct.

## [0.14.7] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- fix(backend-extendr): add `skip_impl_constructor` flag to `RustBindingConfig` and set it
  `true` for the extendr backend. The in-class `impl T { fn new(...) }` constructor is now
  suppressed; callers must use the kwargs-style free-function constructor (already generated
  by `gen_extendr_kwargs_constructor`). This prevents "TryFrom<&Robj> not satisfied" compile
  errors when struct parameters cannot be auto-converted by extendr.
- fix(backend-extendr): methods whose parameters take owned non-opaque structs by value, or
  whose return type is an enum, are now excluded from the `#[extendr]` impl block. Extendr
  generates `TryFrom<&Robj>` for references (`&T`) but not for owned values (`T`), and has
  no `ToVectorValue` impl for enum types; including such methods caused E0277 and E0277
  compile errors in the R binding.
- fix(backend-extendr): methods whose parameters take `Vec<T>` where T is a non-opaque,
  non-enum struct are also excluded from the `#[extendr]` impl block. There is no automatic
  R-list→Vec<ExternalPtr<T>> conversion in extendr.
- fix(codegen/extendr-kwargs): struct-typed fields (non-opaque, non-enum named types) are
  now omitted from the kwargs constructor parameter list and body. Extendr generates
  `TryFrom<&Robj>` only for `&T` (reference), not for owned `T`; including them as kwargs
  parameters caused "T: TryFrom<&Robj> not satisfied" compile errors.
- fix(codegen/extendr-kwargs): fields whose type is already `Option<T>` are no longer
  double-wrapped — the parameter type is now the same as the field type rather than
  `Option<Option<T>>`.
- fix(codegen/core-to-binding): `Vec<u8/u16/u32/i8/i16>` fields with `cast_uints_to_i32`
  are now converted element-wise (`v.iter().map(|&x| x as i32).collect()`) so R receives
  integer vectors instead of raw byte arrays.
- fix(backend-napi/pyo3/php): set `skip_impl_constructor: false` explicitly in those
  backends' `RustBindingConfig` initializers (no behaviour change; required after the new
  field was added to the struct).

## [0.14.6] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- fix(backend-ffi): `Vec<T>` parameters now always emit a concrete turbofish type annotation
  (`serde_json::from_str::<Vec<String>>(...)`) in generated FFI functions. Previously the
  annotation was only emitted when `is_ref || is_mut`; without it, calls to Rust core functions
  with generic bounds (e.g. `fn f<T: AsRef<str>>(v: Vec<T>)`) failed to compile with E0283
  "type annotations needed".

## [0.14.5] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- fix(backend-extendr): add `cast_uints_to_i32` and `cast_large_ints_to_f64` flags to
  `ConversionConfig` so the R binding maps u8/u16/u32/i8/i16 → `i32` and u64/usize/isize → `f64`
  in both binding→core and core→binding From impls. Without these casts, primitive type
  mismatches caused ~100 E0308 errors in the generated R binding.
- fix(backend-extendr): generate `#[extendr]` on impl blocks (previously `method_block_attr: None`)
  so generated structs register as R classes and satisfy the `ToVectorValue` trait bound.
- fix(backend-extendr): import `std::collections::HashMap` and `extendr_api::Result` in the
  generated binding so HashMap fields compile and `Result<T>` is unambiguously the extendr alias.
- fix(codegen/extendr-kwargs): optional struct fields (where `field.optional=true`) in the
  kwargs constructor now assign `Some(v)` instead of `v` so `Option<T>` fields are set correctly.
- fix(codegen/extendr-kwargs): enum fields in kwargs constructors now accept `Option<String>` and
  parse via serde_json instead of `Option<EnumType>`, which extendr cannot convert from Robj.
- fix(backend-extendr): skip opaque types that use `Rc` internally (identified by having a cfg
  gate) from struct generation and from field inclusion in non-opaque structs. `VisitorHandle` is
  `Rc<RefCell<dyn HtmlVisitor>>` and cannot be wrapped in `Arc` — its binding struct would
  violate `Send + Sync` bounds. Affected fields (e.g. `visitor` on `ConversionOptions`) are
  excluded from struct generation and conversion impls.
- fix(trait_bridge/extendr): use `List::from_pairs(attrs_pairs).into()` instead of the invalid
  `collect::<List>()` pattern for building named R lists from attribute key-value pairs.

- fix(backend-napi): NAPI options_field_bridge now preserves visitor handle across
  options conversion. The From<JsConversionOptions> impl was unconditionally setting
  visitor to Default::default() due to opaque field handling. Fixed by extracting
  the visitor before conversion and re-assigning it after the Into call.
- fix(backend-pyo3): PyO3 convert wrapper now reads visitor from options.visitor
  when the separate `visitor=` kwarg is None. This allows Python callers to pass
  the visitor via ConversionOptions without requiring a separate keyword argument.
- fix(e2e/wasm): replace static package imports with dynamic imports + top-level
  await to defer WASM module loading until after vite plugins have processed it.
  Fixes "failed to initialize WebAssembly bundle" errors in vitest e2e tests.
- fix(e2e/php): when `result_is_simple = true`, generated assertions now access the
  `content` property of the ConversionResult object instead of passing the object
  directly to assertion methods. Fixes TypeError when trimming or comparing results.
- fix(backend-pyo3): plain data structs now emit `#[pyclass(frozen)]` instead of
  `#[pyclass(unsendable)]`. The previous code used the transitive-closure set
  (`opaque_names_set`) to decide between frozen and unsendable, causing any struct
  whose fields transitively referenced an opaque type to be marked unsendable. Data
  structs are `Send + Sync` and crossing thread boundaries in async Python code must
  not panic with "<TypeName> is unsendable". Only truly-opaque Arc/Rc-wrapped handles
  need the unsendable annotation.
- fix(backend-go): `Vec<T>` function return types now emit `[]T` (a value slice) instead
  of `*[]T` (a pointer to a slice). Pointer-to-slice is unidiomatic in Go, breaks
  `len(result)` calls, and is unnecessary since Go slices are already reference types.
- fix(e2e/csharp): generate `List<string>` parameter type for VisitTableRow method
  (was `IReadOnlyList<string>`), emit `new VisitResult.XXX()` instead of
  `VisitResult.XXX()` to correctly instantiate sealed record types, and call
  `ConvertWithVisitor` instead of `Convert` when a visitor is present in fixtures.

## [0.14.4] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- fix(backend-pyo3): Required parameters whose Rust type is a has-default struct
  (e.g. `ExtractionConfig`) are now treated as optional at the Python wrapper layer.
  Callers may pass `None` and the wrapper substitutes a Rust default-constructed
  instance. Previously the PyO3 binding panicked with `.expect("'param' is required")`.
- feat(backend-pyo3): emit pass-through wrappers for trait-bridge `unregister_*` and
  `clear_*` functions in `api.py` so callers can use the public package path.
- fix(backend-go): Rust newtype-tuple enums (e.g.
  `enum OutputFormat { Plain, Markdown, Custom(String) }`) are now rendered as Go
  string types with const variants and a Custom fallthrough, instead of empty
  structs. Fixes JSON unmarshaling of config fields like `output_format: "markdown"`.
- fix(e2e/go): callable detection no longer skips fixtures with reason "non-HTTP
  fixture: Go binding does not expose a callable for the configured `[e2e.call]`
  function" — Go does expose the canonical 27 fns. Real test bodies are now
  emitted from the e2e generator, mirroring the Rust backend pattern.
- fix(backend-ffi): emit `visitor_create`/`free`/`convert_with_visitor` when both
  `options_field` and `visitor_callbacks` are configured.
- fix(wasm-visitor): use marker-relative search for visitor replacement; use
  bounded `replace` within impl blocks to avoid cross-impl pollution.
- feat(backend-napi): add `gen_options_field_bridge_function` for visitor
  embedding in options.

### Fixed (carry-forward from unreleased v0.14.3 follow-ups)

- fix(e2e/elixir): inject visitor into the options map argument instead of passing it as a
  separate positional argument, so the Elixir facade's `convert/2` can properly extract it
  via `Map.pop(options, :visitor)` and dispatch to the NIF with visitor callbacks.
- fix(e2e/elixir): read `returns_result` from the language override when available instead of
  always using the base CallConfig value, enabling `returns_result = true` in Elixir overrides
  to generate proper `{:ok, result} =` pattern matches in assertions.
- fix(backend-napi): when `bind_via = "options_field"` is configured for a trait bridge,
  extract the visitor from the options struct before conversion, create the bridge, and
  manually inject it into the converted core options. This ensures visitor callbacks
  are preserved across the NAPI FFI boundary instead of being dropped during the
  JsConversionOptions -> ConversionOptions Into conversion.
- fix(backend-pyo3): emit a `_coerce_enum(enum_cls, value)` helper in the generated
  api.py wrapper and use it in `_to_rust_*` converters instead of attempting
  `_rust.<Enum>(value)`. PyO3 unit-enum pyclasses do not expose a string-accepting
  `__new__`, so the previous codegen raised `TypeError: cannot create '<Enum>'
  instances` when callers passed string aliases like `'atx'`. The helper coerces
  strings, snake_case, UPPER_CASE, and CamelCase to the canonical class attribute.
- fix(backend-java): stop emitting illegal `Optional<String>` accessor methods that
  shadow the canonical record component accessor. Java records auto-generate the
  accessor with the field's declared type and disallow overrides with a different
  signature. Callers that want `Optional` can wrap with `Optional.ofNullable(...)`.
- fix(e2e/java): wrap nullable record-component accessors with `Optional.ofNullable`
  before calling `.orElse(...)`, so the existing assertion templates work whether the
  underlying type is `Optional<X>` or `@Nullable X`.
- fix(cli/build): resolve mvn working directory by walking up from `[crates.output].java`
  to the nearest `pom.xml`, so configurations that point output at `src/main/java/`
  still build via maven from the project root.
- fix(cli/build): when the cargo `[crates.output].<lang>` directory is itself inside a
  standalone crate that declares `[workspace]` (extendr's `packages/r/src/rust/`), `cd`
  into that crate and run `cargo build` instead of treating it as a workspace member.
- fix(cli): keep the test module after all items so clippy's `items_after_test_module` check
  passes in the full pre-commit suite.
- fix(e2e/typescript): simplify generated `is_empty` assertion emission so clippy remains
  warning-clean under `-D warnings`.
- fix(backend-pyo3): import native unit enums referenced only through data-enum aliases in generated
  `options.py`, keeping runtime aliases such as `ToolChoice = ToolChoiceMode | str | SpecificToolChoice`
  import-safe and ruff-clean.
- fix(e2e/go): derive generated Go e2e imports and local `replace` paths from `[go]` package
  configuration when no explicit `[e2e.packages.go]` entry is present, import `testify/assert`
  for every assertion kind that emits `assert.*`, and only emit direct Go calls when an explicit
  Go callable override exists.
- fix(cli/test): resolve e2e-only test languages in `alef test --e2e` without leaking the
  test-only resolver into scaffold generation.
- fix(e2e/elixir): emit fixture IDs as generated ExUnit test labels so long fixture
  descriptions cannot exceed Elixir's test name limit.
- fix(scaffold/ruby): omit workspace lints from standalone Ruby native extension crates.
- fix(e2e/csharp): default generated project references to Alef's nested C# package
  project path.
- fix(e2e/csharp): read namespace from `[crates.csharp].namespace` in alef.toml when
  generating test imports, fixing mismatch with generated package namespace.
- fix(e2e/go): render string containment assertions through `fmt.Sprint` so structured
  slices such as `[]StructureItem` compile.
- fix(backend-csharp): emit free P/Invoke declarations for all true opaque handle
  wrappers, including handles that only appear in generated wrapper classes.
- fix(backend-magnus): borrow field types when detecting thread-unsafe visitor
  handles so the backend compiles cleanly.
- fix(e2e/wasm): declare Rollup in generated WASM Vitest harnesses so Vite plugins
  can load in isolated installs.
- fix(e2e/go): compute imports from executable Go fixtures only so skip-only files
  compile without unused imports.
- fix(backend-go): decode Rust data-enum JSON into Go discriminated structs with
  a printable variant name instead of silently returning nil conversion results.
- fix(e2e/go): stringify structured array fields as JSON for containment assertions
  so pointer fields compare by value instead of address.
- fix(backend-go): marshal decoded data-enum variants back to their variant names so
  generated JSON-based e2e assertions can inspect them.

## [0.14.3] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- feat(codegen/doc-emission): shared `parse_rustdoc_sections`,
  `parse_arguments_bullets`, and `replace_fence_lang` helpers in
  `alef-codegen::doc_emission`. Rustdoc Markdown H1 headings (`# Arguments`,
  `# Returns`, `# Errors`, `# Panics`, `# Safety`, `# Example`/`# Examples`)
  are parsed into a typed `RustdocSections` struct that every host renderer
  consumes. ` ```rust ` fences inside `# Example` bodies are rewritten to
  host-native language tags (`typescript`, `php`, `csharp`, …); pound signs
  inside non-Rust fences (e.g. shell `# install …`) are preserved.
- feat(codegen/doc-emission): per-host section renderers
  `render_jsdoc_sections`, `render_javadoc_sections`,
  `render_csharp_xml_sections`, `render_phpdoc_sections`, and
  `render_doxygen_sections`. JSDoc emits `@param` / `@returns` / `@throws` /
  `@example` with ` ```typescript ` fences. JavaDoc emits `@param` / `@return`
  / `@throws KreuzbergRsException`. C# XML doc emits `<param>` / `<returns>`
  / `<exception cref="…">` / `<example><code language="csharp">`. PHPDoc emits
  `@param` / `@return` / `@throws` / ` ```php ` example fences. Doxygen emits
  `\param` / `\return` / `\code` / `\endcode`.
- feat(codegen/trait-bridge): shared `host_function_path` helper in
  `alef-codegen::generators::trait_bridge` replaces the duplicated per-backend
  `<lang>_host_function_path` inline helpers. pyo3, napi, magnus, ext-php-rs,
  rustler, extendr, and wasm now consume the same resolution logic.
- feat(backend-magnus/unregister-clear): emit `pub fn unregister_<name>(name:
  String) -> Result<(), magnus::Error>` and `pub fn clear_<plural>() ->
  Result<(), magnus::Error>` when `bridge_config.unregister_fn` / `clear_fn`
  are set. Errors are wrapped through `Ruby::exception_runtime_error`.
- feat(backend-php/unregister-clear): emit `#[php_function] pub fn
  unregister_<name>(name: String) -> ext_php_rs::prelude::PhpResult<()>` and
  the matching `clear_<plural>()` function. Errors are mapped through
  `PhpException::default(format!("{}", e))`.
- feat(backend-rustler/unregister-clear): emit `#[rustler::nif] pub fn
  unregister_<name>(env: rustler::Env<'_>, name: String) -> rustler::Atom`
  and `clear_<plural>()` returning `:ok` / `:error` atoms.
- feat(backend-wasm/unregister-clear): emit `#[wasm_bindgen] pub fn
  unregister_<name>(name: String) -> Result<(), JsValue>` and matching
  `clear_<plural>()` wrappers; surfaced via `gen_bindings/mod.rs` so the
  generated bridge re-exports them in `index.ts`.
- feat(backend-extendr/unregister-clear): emit `#[extendr] pub fn
  unregister_<name>(name: String)` / `clear_<plural>()` for R bindings.
- feat(backend-pyo3/host_function_path): pyo3 register/unregister/clear
  bridges now share the centralised host-function path resolver, eliminating
  the duplicated inline helper and matching the resolution rules used by all
  other backends.
- feat(backend-napi/host_function_path): napi register/unregister/clear
  bridges now share the centralised resolver.

### Fixed

- fix(backend-napi): preserve Rust `Default` values when converting omitted
  fields on defaultable JavaScript config objects instead of falling back to
  per-field zero values.
- fix(backends): remove dead PyO3 and Magnus backend code paths so workspace
  builds are warning-clean.
- fix(e2e): make TypeScript assertions handle `null` empty results and string
  containment checks against arrays of structured objects.
- fix(backend-napi/errors): JSDoc rendering for `KreuzbergError` variants now
  goes through the shared per-host renderer instead of leaking raw rustdoc
  Markdown headings into emitted error class JSDoc blocks.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- feat(extract/normalize-rustdoc): doc comments parsed from Rust source are now run through
  a `normalize_rustdoc` pass before any backend sees them. Two specific rustdoc artefacts
  that previously leaked into every binding are removed:
  - Rustdoc-hidden lines inside ```rust /```rust,no_run fences (`# tokio_test::block_on(async {`,
    `# Ok::<(), Error>(())`, `# }`, `# async fn example()`) are dropped.
  - Intra-doc-link syntax `[`crate::Foo`]` / `[`super::Bar`] /`[`self::X`]` is rewritten to
    plain `` `Foo` `` / `` `Bar` `` / `` `X` ``.
  Per-host renderers (Javadoc, KDoc, PHPDoc, JSDoc, Dartdoc, Swift-DocC, roxygen2, Doxygen)
  continue to translate `# Errors`/`# Returns`/etc. as before — full per-host code-fence
  translation deferred to v0.14.3.

- feat(error-gen/strip-thiserror-placeholders): added `strip_thiserror_placeholders` and
  `acronym_aware_snake_phrase` helpers in `alef-codegen::error_gen`. Display strings emitted
  by binding error renderers (Go sentinels, Dart `String get message`) no longer contain raw
  `{name}` substitution markers (`OCR error: {message}` becomes `OCR error`, `extraction
  cancelled` is preserved). Variant names with technical acronyms (IO, OCR, PDF, URL, HTTP, …)
  render as `IO error` / `OCR error`, not `iO error` / `oCR error`.

- feat(backend-dart/error-render): Dart sealed-class exceptions now use the new placeholder
  stripping so `String get message => 'Parsing error: {message}'` is emitted as
  `'Parsing error'`. Surviving prose still has `'`, `\`, and `$` escaped per Dart string
  literal rules.

- feat(backend-zig/trait-bridge): the `make_<trait>_vtable` doc comment was missing a
  `format!()` call, leaking the literal `{snake}` template string. Substitution now
  happens correctly so generated docs read `make_post_processor_vtable(MyType, …)` etc.

- feat(trait-bridge/unregister-clear): `[[trait_bridges]]` schema gains optional
  `unregister_fn` and `clear_fn` fields. When set, alef emits matching host-language
  wrappers alongside `register_fn`. Pyo3 and napi backends opt in this release; remaining
  backends (magnus, php, rustler, gleam, extendr, dart, swift, kotlin, csharp, java,
  wasm) fall through to the default `None` (no emission) — those will be added in v0.14.3.
  The host-language wrappers call the user's plugin module function (e.g.
  `kreuzberg::plugins::ocr_backend::unregister_ocr_backend(&name)`); the path is derived
  from the bridge's `registry_getter` (`get_*_registry` → `*::*_fn_name`).

### Fixed

- fix(error-gen/go-sentinel): Go sentinel error strings no longer contain literal
  `{message}` / `{plugin_name}` / `{elapsed_ms}` placeholders. Variants like `IoError`,
  `OcrError`, `PdfError` render as `errors.New("IO error")`, `errors.New("OCR error")`,
  `errors.New("PDF error")` instead of the previous `errors.New("iO error")`,
  `errors.New("oCR error: {message}")`.

### Deferred to v0.14.3

- Per-host doc-comment section translation (`# Arguments` → `@param`, `# Returns` →
  `@returns`, `# Errors` → `@throws`, etc.) for JSDoc, JavaDoc, C# XML, PHPDoc, dartdoc,
  roxygen2, KDoc, Swift-DocC, Doxygen, Elixir doctests. Foundation in
  `alef-codegen::doc_emission` is unchanged.
- `gen_unregistration_fn` / `gen_clear_fn` for magnus, php, rustler, gleam, extendr,
  dart, swift, kotlin, csharp, java, wasm. Schema is in place; backends opt in incrementally.

### Fixed (carry-forward from unreleased v0.14.1 follow-ups)

- fix(cli): fix alef-verify ↔ host-formatter circular drift in `generate` and `all` commands.
  `format_generated` was called with only the bindings slice, so languages where only stubs
  changed (cache-hit bindings) were never formatted before `finalize_hashes` ran. Host
  formatters (ruff, mix format, php-cs-fixer, gofmt) would then reformat the unformatted
  stubs, making the embedded `alef:hash:` line stale and causing `alef verify` to report
  drift on every run. Fix: pass `bindings + stubs` combined to `format_generated` in both
  `Commands::Generate` and `Commands::All`, and track stub-changed languages in
  `changed_languages` in `Commands::All`.

- fix(e2e): add `node`/`wasm` default formatters (`npx oxfmt {dir}`) to `alef_e2e::format`.
  `run_formatters` had no entry for TypeScript e2e output, so hashes were embedded over raw
  codegen bytes; prek's oxfmt hook then reformatted those files, making `alef verify` report
  28 stale TS files after every `alef e2e generate` / `alef e2e generate --registry` run.

- fix(cli,e2e): add `cargo sort` to Ffi/Wasm/rust-e2e formatter pipelines before hash
  finalisation. `cargo-sort` normalises `Cargo.toml` dependency-table ordering and feature
  indentation; without it, prek's `cargo-sort` hook reformatted those files after
  `finalize_hashes` ran, causing `alef verify` to report `crates/*-wasm/Cargo.toml`,
  `e2e/rust/Cargo.toml`, and `test_apps/rust/Cargo.toml` as stale on every run.
  - `Language::Ffi` formatter now runs `cargo fmt --all` then `cargo sort -w` (workspace).
  - `Language::Wasm` formatter now runs `cargo fmt --manifest-path` then `cargo sort <crate>`.
  - E2e rust default formatter now runs `cargo fmt --all && cargo sort .` inside the crate dir.

- fix(php): respect namespace config in php_autoload_namespace. After v0.14.0, the namespace
  emission logic regressed and ignored the `[crates.php] namespace` configuration, instead
  splitting the extension name on underscores. Now respects explicit namespace override.

- fix(backend-wasm): bridge type aliases (e.g. `VisitorHandle`) are now treated as opaque in
  WASM binding-to-core `From` conversions. Fields of these types now emit `Default::default()`
  instead of `val.visitor.map(Into::into)` (which failed E0277 because `WasmVisitorHandle`
  has no `From` impl to the core `Rc<RefCell<dyn HtmlVisitor>>`). Builder methods on
  has-default structs with bridge parameters also use `.visitor(None)` instead of
  `.visitor(visitor.as_ref().map(|v| &v.inner))` to avoid E0308 type mismatch.

- fix(backend-php): bridge type aliases (e.g. `VisitorHandle`) are now included in
  `opaque_type_names` so that `gen_php_struct` emits `#[serde(skip)]` for fields of those
  types. Without this, structs like `ConversionOptions` that derive `serde::Serialize` +
  `serde::Deserialize` failed E0277 because `VisitorHandle` (an `Arc<Rc<RefCell<dyn
  HtmlVisitor>>>` wrapper) does not implement those traits. Builder methods with bridge
  parameters also use `.visitor(None)` to avoid E0308 type mismatch.

- fix(backend-pyo3): fixed three remaining codegen bugs for PyO3 bindings: (1) `PyVisitorRef::extract` now uses `Borrowed::to_owned()` instead of non-existent `Borrowed::clone()` to avoid E0507 "cannot move out of dereference"; (2) builder methods on has_default structs no longer attempt to access `.inner` for bridge type parameters—visitor parameter skips the core builder's `.visitor()` call and uses `None` instead to avoid E0308 type mismatch; (3) wrapper functions that pass has_default parameters to core functions now wrap the deserialized value in `Some()` when core expects `Option<T>` to fix E0308 "expected Option, found T".

- fix(backend-pyo3): `PyVisitorRef` now uses PyO3 0.28 API correctly. Updated `FromPyObject<'a, 'py>` to accept two lifetimes and use `extract(Borrowed<'a, 'py, PyAny>)` instead of the deprecated `extract_bound()`. Fixed `IntoPyObject` error type to use `Infallible` (conversion cannot fail). Resolves E0407, E0107, E0277, E0308 errors when building against PyO3 0.28.3.

- fix(backend-pyo3): trait types now map to `PyVisitorRef` (a custom wrapper) instead of `Arc<Py<PyAny>>`.
  `Arc<Py<PyAny>>` broke PyO3's `IntoPyObject`/`FromPyObject` field traits (E0277). `PyVisitorRef`
  wraps `Py<PyAny>` in `Arc<>` for cheap cloning while maintaining PyO3 compatibility at struct
  field and parameter boundaries. The wrapper implements Clone via Arc, FromPyObject/IntoPyObject
  for binding integration, and exposes `.inner: Arc<Py<PyAny>>` for trait bridge code generation.

- fix(backend-go): `NodeContext.NodeType` field type is now emitted as `NodeType` (the package-defined
  type alias for `string`) instead of the raw `string` type. The redundant `type NodeType = string`
  declaration in `visitor.go` that caused a redeclaration compile error with `binding.go`'s
  `type NodeType string` has been removed.

- fix(backend-rustler): `gen_native_ex` now emits a `convert_with_visitor/3` NIF stub when
  a `bind_via = "options_field"` bridge is present. Previously only `FunctionParam` bridges
  triggered the visitor-variant stub, causing an `on_load` failure at runtime.

- fix(backend-rustler): `gen_bridge_field_function` now correctly handles optional options
  params. When the core function expects `Option<ConversionOptions>`, the plain NIF no longer
  calls `.unwrap_or_default()` (preserving `None`), and the visitor NIF wraps `options_core`
  in `Some(...)` before passing to the core function.

- fix(alef-codegen/enums): resolved merge-conflict marker in `gen_enum` that broke builds.
  The `#[default]` attribute is now placed on the `is_default`-marked variant (falling back to
  the first variant), matching the Rust core's explicit `#[default]` placement.

- fix(napi): `core_to_binding` conversion now emits `Default::default()` for opaque Named fields
  with `CoreWrapper::None` (e.g. `visitor: Object<'static>`) instead of trying to wrap them
  with `Arc::new` — mirrors the same fix previously applied to `binding_to_core`.

- fix(napi): `gen_opaque_struct_methods` no longer emits `#[napi]` methods whose parameters
  include opaque-typed values by value; NAPI class types don't implement `FromNapiValue`
  and cannot appear as plain method params. Methods without an explicit adapter body are skipped.

- fix(napi/types): opaque Named types in `#[napi(object)]` struct fields are now mapped to
  `napi::bindgen_prelude::Object<'static>` instead of the NAPI class type, which fails the
  `FromNapiValue` bound required by `#[napi(object)]`.

- fix(napi/dts): opaque trait types (e.g. `JsHtmlVisitor`) are now included in the generated
  `index.d.ts`; previously they were excluded by the `!is_trait` filter.

- fix(backend-java): optional record fields now use `@Nullable` annotation instead of
  `Optional<T>` wrapper, making the Java API idiomatically correct. Fields are typed as
  nullable boxed types (e.g. `@Nullable Long` instead of `Optional<Long>`), improving
  compatibility with IDE inspections and code generators.

- fix(backend-java): Javadoc generation now strips Rust-specific syntax (intra-doc links
  like `[`Type`]`, code block fences, and Rust sections like `# Arguments`/`# Errors`)
  to produce valid Java documentation. The `emit_javadoc` helper function applies the
  transformation uniformly across all public API methods.

- fix(backend-java): builder `build()` methods now correctly extract values from `Optional`
  fields using `.orElse(null)` before passing to nullable record constructors.

- fix(backend-java): `convertWithVisitor` method now constructs `ConversionResult` with
  nullable fields instead of `Optional.of()` and `Optional.empty()` calls.

- fix(napi/dts): optional fields in `#[napi(object)]` structs are now correctly marked `?`
  when the field type is `TypeRef::Optional`, `field.optional` is set, or the parent type
  has `has_default = true`.

- fix(e2e/node): removed `"strictNullChecks": false` from e2e tsconfig; strict mode is now
  fully enabled.

- fix(e2e/node): visitor method template double-brace bug fixed and string literals in
  `Custom` callback returns are now properly quoted.

- fix(e2e/node): visitor method parameters are annotated `: any` to satisfy `noImplicitAny`.

- fix(java): bare `catch (Throwable ignored) { return 0; }` in VisitorBridge upcall stubs swallowed
  visitor exceptions silently. The catch clause now captures the first throwable in a sticky
  `volatile Throwable visitorError` field, returns `VISIT_RESULT_ERROR` (4), and surfaces the
  exception via `rethrowVisitorError()` in the `finally` block of `convertWithVisitor`.

- fix(java): `encodeVisitResult` allocated `Custom` markdown and `Error` message buffers into
  `Arena.global()`, leaking them permanently. The method is now a non-static instance method
  that allocates into `this.arena` (the bridge's confined arena), so all buffers are freed on
  `VisitorBridge.close()`.

- fix(java): `checkLastError()` always threw the base exception class. The method now
  dispatches on the native error code: code 1 throws `InvalidInputException`, code 2 throws
  `ConversionErrorException`, and any other code throws the base `{Class}Exception`.

- fix(java): `createObjectMapper()` was called once per FFI invocation, allocating a new
  `ObjectMapper` on every `convert()` call. The factory is now called once at class-load time
  to populate a `private static final ObjectMapper MAPPER` field.

- fix(java): stale generated files `IHtmlVisitor.java`, `HtmlVisitorBridge.java`,
  `TestVisitor.java`, `TestVisitorAdapter.java`, and `VisitContext.java` were emitted by the
  trait-bridge and gen-visitor paths. They are superseded by `Visitor.java` and
  `VisitorBridge.java` in the Panama FFM visitor pattern. All five files are removed from
  generation and deleted from committed output.

- fix(java): `has_visitor_pattern` was evaluated using `config.ffi.visitor_callbacks` which is
  always `None` in the Java backend's `ResolvedCrateConfig`. The check now also activates when
  any `[[trait_bridges]]` entry uses `bind_via = "options_field"`, which is the Java-specific
  visitor activation path.

- fix(java): output path defaulted to `packages/java/` from the workspace template, causing
  generated files to land in `packages/java/dev/kreuzberg/htmltomarkdown/` instead of the
  correct `packages/java/src/main/java/dev/kreuzberg/htmltomarkdown/`. The Java output path is
  now resolved via an explicit `java = "packages/java/src/main/java/"` entry in `[crates.output]`.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- feat(trait-bridge): `[[trait_bridges]]` schema now supports optional `unregister_fn` and
  `clear_fn` fields. When present, alef emits the corresponding host-language wrappers
  alongside the existing `register_fn` codegen. Pyo3 backend implements both new methods;
  remaining backends fall through to the default `None` (no emission).

- feat(error-gen): error-Display strings now have template placeholders (`{message}`,
  `{plugin_name}`, `{elapsed_ms}`, `{limit_ms}`, `{0}`-style positional, etc.) stripped
  before emission. Acronym-aware variant-name splitting recognizes 40+ technical
  acronyms (IO, OCR, PDF, URL, HTTP, TCP, …) and preserves them in the rendered text:
  `IoError` → "IO error", not "iO error". Applies across all error-handling backends.

- feat(pyo3): `register_*` plugin docstrings now use a humanized noun derived from the
  trait name. Previously emitted `"""Register a register_ocr_backend backend."""`
  (placeholder leaked); now emits `"""Register a OCR backend implementation as a runtime plugin."""`.

### Fixed

- fix(extendr): `generate_public_api` no longer emits a duplicate `convert()` wrapper calling
  `.Call("htm_convert", ...)`. extendr generates `extendr-wrappers.R` with the correct
  `.Call(wrap__convert, ...)` symbol; the backend now emits only `@useDynLib` + `options.R`.

- fix(extendr): generated `options.R` now includes all `ConversionOptions` fields from the IR,
  including `exclude_selectors`, `max_image_size`, `capture_svg`, `infer_dimensions`, `max_depth`,
  `skip_images`, `link_style`, `output_format`, `include_document_structure`, `extract_images`,
  and `visitor` (previously missing).

- fix(extendr): visitor pairlist keys no longer carry a leading underscore. Rust uses `_ctx` /
  `_href` for unused default-impl parameters; R callers write `function(ctx, ...)` without the
  prefix. Keys are now trimmed of leading `_`.

- fix(e2e/r): `CallbackAction::Custom` / `CustomTemplate` output values are now quoted in generated
  R: `list(custom = "[AUDIO: podcast.mp3]")` instead of the previous unquoted form that caused a
  parse error.

- fix(e2e/r): `visitor` is now passed inside `options = list(visitor = visitor)` rather than as a
  top-level parameter to `convert()`.

- fix(backend-wasm): use `is_default` variant for generated `Default` impl on wasm enums instead
  of always using the first variant, fixing incorrect defaults for `HeadingStyle`, `CodeBlockStyle`,
  and `PreprocessingPreset`.

- fix(backend-wasm): visitor bridge methods now dispatch `{custom: "..."}` JS objects to
  `VisitResult::Custom(s)` and `{error: "..."}` objects to `VisitResult::Continue`, making the
  full `VisitResult` variant set reachable from JavaScript.

- fix(e2e/wasm): merge visitor into the options object (2nd arg) rather than appending it as a
  standalone 3rd argument, matching the wasm binding's single-object options API.

- fix(backend-napi): use generated `From` conversions for named reference parameters instead of
  JSON round-tripping when let-binding delegation is possible.

- fix(backend-pyo3): generate `__str__` and `__repr__` for Rust-backed enum wrappers so returned
  enum values are inspectable from Python.

- fix(e2e/python): render string containment assertions over configured array fields by checking common DTO text
  attributes instead of comparing directly against the object list.

- fix(alef-cli/format): format WASM binding crates with `cargo fmt --manifest-path`
  derived from the resolved output path so renamed or workspace-excluded crates are handled correctly.

- fix(codegen): use generated `From` conversions for named reference parameters instead of JSON round-tripping when a
  direct let-binding is possible. This preserves fields such as Python `ProcessConfig.language` in free functions.
- fix(codegen): convert Cow-backed string fields with `.into()` when reconstructing `core_self` for binding methods.

- fix(cli): run language-native formatters on stubs before finalising the embedded `alef:hash:` line.
  `alef stubs` previously skipped the format step and computed the hash over raw codegen output.
  When host-language tools (ruff, php-cs-fixer, mix format, cargo fmt, …) reformatted those files,
  the embedded hash no longer matched the on-disk content, causing `alef verify` to report them as stale.

- fix(cli): track stub-changed languages in `changed_languages` during `alef generate`.
  When stubs changed but no bindings changed for a language, the formatter gate
  (`if any_written && !changed_languages.is_empty()`) would skip formatting entirely,
  leaving stub files unformatted and the hash stale after the next formatter run.

- fix(cli): always add stub file paths to `current_gen_paths` before the orphan-sweep pass
  in `alef generate`. When the stub cache was warm, stub paths were not registered,
  causing the sweep to delete freshly-generated stub files (e.g. `.pyi`) as orphans
  on the second generate run.

- fix(csharp): `ConversionOptionsBuilder.Dispose()` and `VisitorHandle.Dispose()` were
  no-op stubs. Opaque handles now emit a `{Name}SafeHandle : SafeHandle` inner class for
  deterministic, exception-safe cleanup. The public wrapper delegates `Dispose()` to it.

- fix(csharp): `optionsHandle` and `visitorHandle` were leaked when `Convert()` or
  `ConvertWithVisitor()` threw. Both handles are now freed in a unified `try/finally` block.

- fix(csharp): `Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi` used throughout — replaced everywhere with
  `Marshal.PtrToStringUTF8` so non-ASCII characters (e.g. Unicode URLs, CJK text) are
  decoded correctly on all platforms.

- fix(csharp): typed exceptions (`InvalidInputException`, `ConversionErrorException`) were
  never thrown. `GetLastError()` now dispatches on the native error code and emits `if`
  branches for each registered exception type.

- fix(csharp): `NodeContext.NodeType` was typed `int` instead of the `NodeType` enum.
  `DecodeNodeContext` now casts `Marshal.ReadInt32` to `(NodeType)`.

- fix(csharp): stale generated files `IVisitor.cs` and `VisitorCallbacks.cs` were still
  emitted by `gen_visitor_files`. They are superseded by `IHtmlVisitor`/`HtmlVisitorBridge`
  in the trait-bridge pattern. Both files are removed from generation and deleted from
  committed output.

- fix(csharp): bare `catch { return 0; }` in visitor upcall thunks swallowed exceptions
  silently. The catch clause now captures the exception and returns the Error discriminant
  (4) with the message encoded via `EncodeString`.

- fix(csharp): outer `packages/csharp/HtmlToMarkdown.csproj` was a NuGet wrapper that
  double-included the inner project's sources, producing duplicate type definitions.
  Added `<Compile Remove="HtmlToMarkdown/**" />`, `<ProjectReference>`, and
  `<GenerateAssemblyInfo>false</GenerateAssemblyInfo>`.

- fix(csharp): `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>` was absent from
  `Directory.Build.props`. Added alongside `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`.

- fix(csharp): `using System.Threading.Tasks` was emitted unconditionally. It is now
  conditionalized on whether the API has any `async` functions or methods.

- fix(csharp): `ConvertWithVisitor` accepted `IVisitor` (old generated interface) instead
  of `IHtmlVisitor` (trait-bridge interface from `TraitBridges.cs`). The method now takes
  `IHtmlVisitor` and wraps it in `HtmlVisitorBridge` instead of the removed `VisitorCallbacks`.

- fix(napi): `mapper.map_type` returns `String`, not `Cow<str>`; removed stale `.into_owned()`
  calls in `crates/alef-backend-napi/src/gen_bindings/types.rs`.

- fix(extendr): removed dead reference to `gen_conversion_options_r` (kreuzberg-specific dead
  code from an earlier project-coupled state).

- fix(codegen): collapsed clippy `if-same-then-else` warning in `config_gen.rs` by combining
  enum-variant and Named-type branches that emit the same body.

- chore(deps): dropped unused `tracing` dep from `alef-core` (only `tracing-test` is used,
  and that's a dev-dep).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- **BREAKING (config schema): `alef.toml` is now multi-crate.** The old single-crate `[crate]` schema is rejected on load with a curated migration message. Run `alef migrate --write` to convert. Internally the loader returns `Vec<ResolvedCrateConfig>` and every backend, codegen pass, scaffold step, e2e generator, and publish step now consumes `&ResolvedCrateConfig` instead of `&AlefConfig`. The `Backend` trait signature changed accordingly. Workspace-wide settings live under `[workspace]`; per-crate settings live under `[[crates]]`.
- alef-cli now iterates every crate in the workspace by default. Add a top-level `--crate <name>` (repeatable) to restrict commands to a subset.
- `alef-backend-swift` / `alef-backend-kotlin`: an explicit `[crates.output] {swift,kotlin}` value is now treated as the verbatim package directory; only the template-derived default constructs the canonical `Sources/<Module>/` (swift) or `src/main/kotlin/<package>/` (kotlin) layout. Predictable rule: explicit override = exactly that path; default template = backend builds the canonical structure.

### Added

- feat(alef-cli): `alef migrate --write` rewrites legacy `alef.toml` in place using an atomic temp-file + rename and refuses to overwrite symlinks. The dry-run default prints a unified diff.
- feat(alef-cli): top-level `--crate <name>` CLI filter (repeatable) selects a subset of the workspace; absent processes every crate. New `crates/alef-cli/src/dispatch.rs` exposes `select_crates` / `is_multi_crate`.
- feat(alef-core): new `WorkspaceConfig` / `RawCrateConfig` / `ResolvedCrateConfig` / `OutputTemplate` types with documented per-field precedence; `OutputTemplate::resolve` rejects path traversal segments and NUL bytes; `WorkspaceConfig`, `RawCrateConfig`, and `NewAlefConfig` use `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` so typos surface as parse errors.
- feat(alef-core): per-crate `compute_crate_sources_hash(&ResolvedCrateConfig)` replaces the legacy `&[PathBuf]` overload so multi-source-crate workspaces produce a single stable hash across all contributing source files.

### Fixed

- fix(e2e-go): avoid double-wrapping `len(...)` in `min_length` / `max_length`
  assertions and generate valid guards for array element length checks.
- fix(e2e-rust): honor call-level `result_is_simple` and `result_is_option`
  flags so optional scalar results are unwrapped before equality assertions.
- fix(codegen): preserve sanitized `Cow<str>` fields in Rust binding DTO serde and binding-to-core conversions.
  Python bindings previously dropped required string fields such as `ProcessConfig.language`, causing generated e2e
  tests to fail with missing-field deserialization errors.
- fix(alef-backend-dart, alef-backend-swift): honor `[crates.dart] frb_version` and `[crates.swift] swift_bridge_version` overrides — the fields were deserialized but every callsite hardcoded the compiled-in default constant.
- fix(alef-cli/migrate): preserve legacy `[crate]` scalars at the top of the generated `[[crates]]` entry by recursively clearing toml_edit position metadata so the resulting document is well-formed even when many language sub-tables follow.
- fix(alef-cli/version-pin): write `[workspace] alef_version` after a successful generate instead of a top-level `version =` line. The legacy detector rejected the top-level form on the next run, breaking re-generation.
- fix(alef-cli/cache): scope IR / lang / stage caches per-crate (`.alef/<crate>/ir.json`, `.alef/<crate>/hashes/<lang>.{hash,manifest}`, `.alef/<crate>/hashes/<stage>.{hash,manifest}`) so multi-crate workspaces no longer poison or overwrite each other's cache entries. `validate_cache_crate_name` rejects path separators, NUL, `..`, `.`.

## [0.13.10] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- feat(codegen): auto-exclude trait-bridge registration functions via `collect_trait_bridge_registration_fn_names()`.
  Each binding backend now automatically excludes `register_*` / `unregister_*` functions to prevent double-emit
  compile errors — downstream consumers no longer need manual `exclude` entries in `alef.toml` for trait-bridge registration fns.

- feat(e2e-go): support disk-path fixture loading in Go e2e harness in addition to HTTP URLs.
  New test infrastructure in `crates/alef-e2e/tests/go_bytes_file_path_fixtures.rs` demonstrates the pattern.

### Fixed

- fix(cli): qualify type-name exclusion entries by Rust path. `apply_filters` previously matched
  `[exclude].types`/`enums`/`errors` entries against the short type name only, so a fully-qualified entry
  like `kreuzberg::core::config::formats::OutputFormat` never actually filtered anything when an
  ambiguously-named type appeared in two pub-use chains. Entries containing `::` are now matched against
  the type's `rust_path` (with hyphens normalised); plain entries continue to match by short name.
  Three regression tests cover plain-name match, qualified-path match, and hyphen normalisation.

- fix(codegen): resolve C# signature mismatch in generated binding code that surfaced during trait-bridge auto-exclusion wiring.

- fix(backend-rustler): emit `if(...)` function-call form instead of `(if ...)` outer-parens form for JSON-encoding options.
  `mix format` rewrites `(if x, do: y, else: z)` → `if(x, do: y, else: z)`, so the outer-parens form caused a hash drift
  on every prek run. The generator now emits the formatter-stable `if(...)` form directly.

- fix(e2e): honor call-level Rust option result flags and use the crate version for registry-mode Rust e2e dependencies when no package override is set.
- fix(e2e): generate valid Go array guards for length assertions on array element fields.
- fix(e2e): honor call-level simple/optional result flags in Go tests and render contains assertions for struct slices.
- fix(e2e): emit nil checks for Go optional simple-result empty assertions.
- fix(backend-java): correct four compile errors in the generated Java convert wrapper
  when `bind_via = "options_field"` is used with an opaque-handle bridge field:
  - B1: the generated `convert()` no longer calls the non-existent
    `htm_conversion_options_from_json` FFI symbol; options are now serialised to JSON
    and passed as a C string directly via `coptionsJsonSeg`.
  - B2: the bridge attachment code now detects that the bridge Java type is an opaque
    handle (e.g. `VisitorHandle`) and calls `options.visitor().handle()` to pass the
    raw `MemorySegment` to the FFI setter, instead of constructing a `VisitorHandleBridge`
    (which does not exist and would require a `Visitor` interface argument).
  - B3: the FFI call argument for the options param is now `coptionsJsonSeg` (matching
    the emitted variable name), not the stale `cOptions` name from the old `_FROM_JSON`
    path.
  - B4: `gen_builder_class` now only emits `.orElse(null)` for optional fields that
    are bridge fields (where the record stores the raw handle type); regular
    `Optional<T>` fields are passed directly to avoid "incompatible types" errors.
- fix(backend-go): preserve `None` as nil for optional string returns.
- fix(backend-go): decode externally tagged Rust enums with string payload fallback
  variants (for example `Other(String)`) as string-like Go enums instead of empty
  structs, and match Rust serde's default unit-variant wire names.
- fix(e2e-go): render `contains` assertions for structured values through JSON
  instead of `%v`, so pointer fields are checked by value.

- fix(backend-go): correct two codegen bugs that produced uncompilable Go bindings when
  `bind_via = "options_field"` is used with an options type that has an Update sibling:
  - Bug A: `ffi_c_struct_name` previously inserted an extra PascalCase prefix segment,
    producing double-prefixed C type names (e.g. `HTMHtmNodeContext`) that do not exist
    in the cbindgen header; the formula now maps Rust struct basenames directly to their
    cbindgen names (e.g. `HTMNodeContext`).
  - Bug B: visitor.go is no longer emitted when all `[[trait_bridges]]` entries use
    `bind_via = "options_field"`; the stale FFI symbols `htm_conversion_options_from_json`,
    `htm_visitor_create`, `htm_visitor_free`, and `htm_convert_with_visitor` are absent
    from the options-field bridge API and caused undefined-symbol link errors.
  - Additionally, non-opaque Named parameters and method receivers whose type has a
    corresponding `{Name}Update` sibling now use the two-step
    `{prefix}_{snake}_update_from_json` + `{prefix}_{snake}_from` pattern instead of the
    removed `{prefix}_{snake}_from_json` helper.

- fix(backend-pyo3): emit SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE aliases alongside PascalCase variants in
  `.pyi` enum stubs so mypy resolves `CodeBlockStyle.BACKTICKS` without `attr-defined`
  errors. Previously only the raw PyO3 names (e.g. `Backticks`) were declared in the stub
  while `options.py` adds the aliases at runtime.

- fix(backend-pyo3): use `object | None` for bridge fields in the `__init__` stub parameter
  list, matching the field annotation. Previously the constructor parameter was typed
  `VisitorHandle | None`, causing a mypy `arg-type` error when passing `value.visitor`
  (typed `object`) from the generated `api.py` conversion helper.

- fix(backend-rustler): wrap inline `if/do/else` JSON-encoding expressions in parentheses
  so the generated NIF call args parse as Elixir when the conditional is followed by a
  visitor parameter. Previously emitted `convert_with_visitor(html, if ..., do: ..., else: ..., visitor)`
  which is invalid syntax — Elixir keyword lists must be the final argument.

- fix(backend-php): null-guard visitor access and correct PSR-4 namespace in generated PHP:
  - `generate_public_api` now emits `$options?->visitor` (null-safe operator) instead of
    `$options->visitor` when the options parameter is optional, eliminating the PHPStan
    "Cannot access property on null" error.
  - Added `generate_scaffold` to `PhpBackend` that emits a `functions.php` convenience
    wrapper using the namespace from `config.php_autoload_namespace()` (which honours
    `[php].namespace` in `alef.toml`), replacing the previously hard-coded wrong
    namespace derived by mechanical case-splitting of the crate name.

- fix(backend-php): resolve compile errors when `bind_via = "options_field"` is used
  in `[[trait_bridges]]` with an options type that has an opaque handle field:
  - `gen_php_struct` now receives `opaque_type_names` from `mod.rs` so
    `gen_struct_with_per_field_attrs` can emit `#[serde(skip)]` on fields whose type
    is an opaque handle (e.g. `VisitorHandle`), fixing 8 `E0277` serde trait errors.
  - `gen_bridge_field_function` now emits `let mut {name}_core` for optional params,
    enabling `options_core.as_mut()` in the generated `visitor_attach` call.
  - `find_bridge_field` (alef-codegen) now sets
    `param_is_optional: is_optional || param.optional`, covering the IR pattern where
    the options param is stored as `ty: Named("T") + optional: true` rather than
    `ty: Optional(Named("T"))`. This caused the wrong `visitor_attach` branch to be
    selected, producing a `no field 'visitor' on type Option<...>` compile error.
  - `gen_php_call_args` now emits `visitor.map(|v| (*v.inner).clone())` for optional
    opaque params, replacing the former `visitor.as_ref().map(|v| &v.inner)` which
    produced a type mismatch (`Option<&Arc<...>>` vs `Option<Rc<...>>`).

- fix(backend-wasm): resolve four compile errors when `bind_via = "options_field"` is
  used in `[[trait_bridges]]` with an options type that has a handle field:
  - `gen_new_method` now appends `..Default::default()` to the struct literal when
    bridge fields are excluded from constructor params, fixing missing-field errors.
  - `gen_opaque_struct_methods` now skips methods whose params contain a
    `type_alias` of an `options_field` bridge (e.g. the builder's `visitor()` method),
    preventing uncompilable Arc-vs-Rc type mismatches in the generated call args.
  - `field_conversion_from_core_cfg` (alef-codegen) now emits `None` for sanitized
    `Named` / `Optional(Named)` fields in WASM mode (`map_uses_jsvalue = true`)
    instead of the Debug-format fallback that produced `Option<String>` rather than
    `Option<JsValue>`.
  - `bridge_fields_map` is extended to cover `{options_type}Update` types so that
    binding→core `From` impls for Update types default the bridge field via
    `Default::default()` instead of calling `val.visitor.map(Into::into)`, which
    fails because `WasmVisitorHandle` has no `Into<VisitorHandle>` impl.
  Also fixes `convertible_types` (alef-codegen) to allow optional sanitized fields
  whose type is `Named(T)` with `optional = true`: the binding stores `Option<T>`
  which is always `Default`, so these types correctly remain in the convertible set.

- fix(backend-ffi): suppress duplicate `{prefix}_convert` symbols in options-field
  bridge mode. When `bind_via = "options_field"` is set, the free-function loop now
  skips ALL `convert` variants (not just sanitized ones), and `gen_convert_no_visitor`
  - `gen_visitor_bindings` are not emitted. The single authoritative `{prefix}_convert`
  comes exclusively from `gen_convert_with_options_field_bridge`. Removes the three
  `htm_convert` definitions that caused a duplicate `#[no_mangle]` compile error in
  html-to-markdown. Also fixes `gen_convert_with_options_field_bridge` to call
  `core::convert(html, options)` with 2 arguments matching the current API (visitor
  is embedded in options, not passed as a third argument).

- fix(e2e): visitor codegen now assigns the synthesized visitor object to
  `options.visitor` (language-idiomatic field assignment) instead of passing it
  as a third positional argument. This aligns e2e test generation with the h2m
  API change where `convert(html, options)` accepts visitor as an optional
  ConversionOptions field rather than a separate parameter. Implemented for:
  - Rust: mutate options binding after construction to attach visitor
  - Ruby: insert visitor key into options hash inline
  - PHP: merge visitor as separate options object
  - Python, TypeScript: already correct (kwargs/object-field pattern)
  Remaining languages (Go, Java, C#, Elixir, R, Gleam, Kotlin, Zig, Swift,
  WASM, Dart, C) require equivalent updates to move visitor from positional
  arg to options field assignment (patterns will vary per language syntax).

- fix(backend-napi): resolve all compile errors when `bind_via = "options_field"`
  is used in `[[trait_bridges]]` with a NAPI-RS binding:
  - `gen_struct` bridge-field substitution (emit `Option<Object<'static>>` instead of
    `Option<JsVisitorHandle>`) is now applied BEFORE the `field.sanitized` guard, so it
    correctly fires for bridge fields that are NOT sanitized (e.g. `visitor` in
    `ConversionOptions` has `sanitized: false`).
  - `gen_struct` now also builds a set of all bridge `type_alias` values and applies the
    `Option<Object<'static>>` substitution to ANY field whose type is a bridge alias
    (e.g. `ConversionOptionsUpdate.visitor`), not only fields in the declared
    `options_type`. This prevents `JsVisitorHandle: FromNapiValue not satisfied` errors
    in Update-pattern structs.
  - `bridge_fields_by_type` (used to populate `force_default_fields` for From
    conversions) is extended by case (b): any type with a field whose type is a bridge
    type alias is now included, so binding→core and core→binding `From` impls emit
    `Default::default()` instead of `val.visitor.map(Into::into)` for those fields.
  - `gen_opaque_struct_methods` now skips methods whose params contain a `type_alias`
    of an `options_field` bridge (e.g. `ConversionOptionsBuilder::visitor()`),
    preventing uncompilable Arc-vs-Rc type mismatches in the generated call args.

- fix(backend-pyo3): resolve all compile errors when `bind_via = "options_field"`
  is used in `[[trait_bridges]]` with a PyO3 binding:
  - `extra_field_attrs` now returns `vec![]` for bridge fields, preventing
    duplicate `#[pyo3(get)]` and `#[serde(skip)]` attributes.
  - `rewrite_bridge_field_type` now accepts `type_alias: Option<&str>` and
    also rewrites `Option<{alias}>` patterns (e.g. `Option<VisitorHandle>`),
    not only the legacy `Option<String>` placeholder.
  - `rewrite_bridge_field_impl` now rewrites constructor parameter types
    (`visitor: Option<VisitorHandle>` → `visitor: Option<Py<PyAny>>`).
  - Struct generation for both the primary options type and related types
    (e.g. `ConversionOptionsUpdate`) that share the same bridge field name
    now applies the full set of rewrites: field type override, `frozen` →
    `unsendable`, and manual `Clone` impl using `Python::attach`/`clone_ref`.
  - `bridge_field_name_for_type` extends From-conversion post-processing to
    cover related types (`ConversionOptionsUpdate`) that are not listed as
    `options_type` in `alef.toml` but share the bridge field name.
  - Opaque types whose name matches a bridge `type_alias` (e.g. `VisitorHandle`)
    and builder types for bridge options types (e.g. `ConversionOptionsBuilder`)
    now use `#[pyclass(unsendable)]` because they transitively contain
    `Rc<RefCell<dyn Trait>>`.
  - Builder opaque impl: `visitor.as_ref().map(|v| &v.inner)` rewritten to
    `visitor.map(|v| (*v.inner).clone())` to pass `Rc<RefCell<...>>` (not a
    reference into Arc) to the core builder's `.visitor()` method.
  - `gen_bridge_field_function` in `trait_bridge.rs` now uses
    `Python::attach(|py| v.clone_ref(py))` to extract the visitor from
    `Option<Py<PyAny>>`, replacing the former `.clone()` call that requires
    the `py-clone` feature (not enabled in most consumers).

- fix(backend-csharp): drop stale `[DllImport]` declarations and fix the visitor
  attach path when `bind_via = "options_field"` is active:
  - `gen_native_methods` no longer emits `{prefix}_conversion_options_from_json`
    for options types owned by an options-field bridge; those types are constructed
    via the `UpdateFromJson` + `FromUpdate` pair that still exists in the FFI surface.
  - `gen_native_methods_visitor` now returns an empty string when an options-field
    bridge is present, suppressing the stale `{prefix}_convert_with_visitor`,
    `{prefix}_visitor_create`, and `{prefix}_visitor_free` P/Invoke declarations.
  - `gen_wrapper_function` now emits `{opts}.{Field}._vtable` directly instead of
    double-wrapping the already-constructed `{bridge_type}Bridge` in a second `new
    {bridge_type}Bridge(...)`, eliminating the `CS1503` type mismatch compile error.
  - `ffi_symbol()` on `OptionsFieldBridgeInfo` now produces
    `{prefix}_options_set_{field}` (matching `alef-backend-ffi::gen_bridge_field`)
    instead of the former `{prefix}_{opts_snake}_set_{field}` mismatch.

### Added

- feat(backend-pyo3): wire `bind_via = "options_field"` bridge support. When a
  `[[trait_bridges]]` entry sets `bind_via = "options_field"`, the PyO3 backend now:
  - Emits `visitor: Option<Py<PyAny>>` on the `ConversionOptions` pyclass (overriding
    the IR-sanitized `String` type via a targeted post-process rewrite).
  - Switches the `ConversionOptions` pyclass attribute from `frozen` to `unsendable`
    because the struct embeds `Rc<RefCell<dyn HtmlVisitor>>` via `Py<PyAny>` and is
    `!Send`; `unsendable` enforces single-thread GIL access.
  - Generates a `convert` wrapper that extracts `options.visitor`, builds a
    `PyHtmlVisitorBridge`, sets it on the core `ConversionOptions.visitor` field via
    `std::rc::Rc::new(std::cell::RefCell::new(bridge)) as VisitorHandle`, then calls
    core convert — no separate `convert_with_visitor` export.
  - Updates `.pyi` stubs: the visitor field on `ConversionOptions` is typed as
    `object | None` instead of `str | None`.
  Re-exports `find_bridge_field` and `BridgeFieldMatch` from `alef-codegen` through
  the pyo3 `trait_bridge` module.

- feat(backend-napi): wire `bind_via = "options_field"` bridge support — visitor field on
  `JsConversionOptions` is emitted as `Option<Object<'static>>`, the `convert` wrapper
  extracts it, builds the `JsHtmlVisitorBridge`, sets it on core options, and calls core;
  the `.d.ts` interface shows `visitor?: HtmlVisitor`; no separate `convertWithVisitor`
  export is emitted in this mode.
- feat(backend-extendr): support `bind_via = "options_field"` in `[[trait_bridges]]`.
  When a visitor bridge is configured in options-field mode the R/extendr backend now:
  - Renders the bridge field as `Option<extendr_api::Robj>` on the binding options struct
    (with `#[serde(skip)]` so JSON round-trips ignore it).
  - Emits a custom `From<BindingOptions> for core::Options` impl that leaves the bridge
    field at `Default::default()`; the convert wrapper sets it explicitly after building
    the bridge from the R object.
  - Updates the `new_<options>` kwargs constructor to accept the visitor as
    `Option<extendr_api::Robj>` and assign it via `Some(v)`.
  - Emits a `convert` wrapper (via `gen_bridge_field_function`) that takes
    `options: Option<ConversionOptions>`, pulls the visitor field off the binding,
    constructs `RHtmlVisitorBridge`, attaches it to `options_core.visitor` as
    `Rc<RefCell<...>> as VisitorHandle`, and calls core convert.
  - Does NOT emit a separate `convert_with_visitor` extendr export.
  Re-exports `find_bridge_field` and `BridgeFieldMatch` from `alef-codegen` through
  the extendr `trait_bridge` module.
- feat(backend-rustler): support `bind_via = "options_field"` in `[[trait_bridges]]`.
  When a visitor bridge is configured in options-field mode the Elixir Rustler backend
  now emits:
  - A regular `convert` NIF (ignores any visitor field in the options JSON).
  - A `convert_with_visitor` NIF with the visitor appended as `Option<rustler::Term<'_>>`,
    generated by the new `gen_bridge_field_function` helper.
  - A `visitor` field (nil default) on the `ConversionOptions` Elixir struct.
  - A `convert/2` Elixir wrapper that calls `Map.pop(options, :visitor)` and dispatches
    to either the async NIF+receive-loop (visitor present) or the plain NIF (no visitor).
  - `convert_with_visitor` is not re-exported as a public Elixir function.
  Re-exports `find_bridge_field` and `BridgeFieldMatch` from `alef-codegen` through
  the `trait_bridge` module.
- feat(backend-ffi): support `bind_via = "options_field"` in `[[trait_bridges]]`.
  When a bridge is configured in options-field mode, `alef-backend-ffi` now:
  - Emits `{prefix}_options_set_{field}(options, visitor)` — a setter that wraps
    the vtable bridge in a thin `Rc<RefCell<VtableRef>>` and stores it on the
    options struct's visitor field.
  - Emits `{prefix}_convert(html, options)` (options carries the embedded visitor)
    instead of the generic sanitized stub.
  - Does NOT emit `{prefix}_convert_with_visitor` — the single `{prefix}_convert`
    entry point replaces it.
  - Suppresses `{prefix}_{options_type}_from_json` for types that own a bridge
    field, because the visitor cannot survive a JSON round-trip.
  New symbol emitted for h2m: `htm_options_set_visitor`.
- feat(docs): render trait-bridged fields as struct fields on options types when
  configured with `bind_via = "options_field"`. The visitor bridge type is rendered
  with language-appropriate syntax (e.g. `HtmlVisitor(Protocol)` for Python,
  `HtmlVisitor (interface)` for TypeScript), and the field description is
  auto-generated if not explicitly documented.
- feat(core/codegen): trait bridges may now declare `bind_via = "options_field"`
  on `[[trait_bridges]]` (with `options_type` and optional `options_field`)
  to indicate that the bridge handle lives as a struct field on a function
  parameter rather than as its own positional argument. Adds the
  `BridgeBinding` enum, the `find_bridge_field` codegen helper, and updates
  `find_bridge_param` to skip bridges configured for options-field binding.
  Existing configs default to `function_param` (the legacy mode), so this is
  fully backwards compatible.
- feat(backend-wasm): support `bind_via = "options_field"` in `[[trait_bridges]]`.
  When a visitor bridge is configured in options-field mode the WASM/wasm-bindgen backend now:
  - Emits the bridge field as `Option<JsValue>` on the binding struct (e.g. `visitor` on
    `WasmConversionOptions`) with a matching `#[wasm_bindgen(getter)]` / `setter`.
  - Excludes the bridge field from the `new()` constructor — callers set it via the setter.
  - Marks the bridge field `sanitized` in the cloned IR so the auto-generated
    `From<WasmConversionOptions>` emits `Default::default()` for it.
  - Generates a `convert` wrapper (via `gen_bridge_field_function`) that extracts the
    `Option<JsValue>` from the binding options, converts the rest to core options via
    `From`, builds `WasmHtmlVisitorBridge`, wraps it as
    `Rc<RefCell<...>> as VisitorHandle`, sets it on core options, and calls core convert.
  - Does NOT emit a standalone `convertWithVisitor` function in this mode.
  Re-exports `find_bridge_field` and `BridgeFieldMatch` from `alef-codegen` through
  the wasm `trait_bridge` module.
- feat(backend-csharp): support `bind_via = "options_field"` in `[[trait_bridges]]`.
  When a visitor bridge is configured in options-field mode the C# backend now:
  - Emits a `[JsonIgnore] public {Trait}Bridge? {Field}` property on the options
    record type so the bridge object is excluded from JSON serialization.
  - Declares an `internal static extern void {Options}Set{Field}(IntPtr options, IntPtr vtable)`
    P/Invoke entry-point in `NativeMethods.cs` whose FFI symbol is
    `{prefix}_{options_snake}_set_{field_snake}`.
  - Injects a bridge-attachment block in the wrapper `Convert` method: when
    `options.Visitor != null`, creates the bridge, calls the setter, then calls the
    standard two-arg `convert(html, options)` FFI function.
  - Does NOT emit a separate `ConvertWithVisitor` overload in this mode.
- feat(backend-php): support `bind_via = "options_field"` in `[[trait_bridges]]`.
  When a visitor bridge is configured in options-field mode the PHP/ext-php-rs backend now:
  - Renders the bridge field as `?HtmlVisitor` on the `ConversionOptions` type stub
    (overriding the IR-sanitized `?string` type).
  - Generates a `convert` wrapper (via `gen_bridge_field_function`) that takes all original
    params plus a hidden `{field}_obj: Option<&mut ZendObject>` extra param, builds
    `PhpHtmlVisitorBridge::new`, wraps it in `Rc<RefCell<...>> as VisitorHandle`, attaches it
    to the core options struct, and calls core convert.
  - The PHP facade passes `$options->visitor` as the extra hidden arg when delegating to the
    native extension class.
  - Does NOT emit a standalone `convertWithVisitor` function.
  Re-exports `find_bridge_field` and `BridgeFieldMatch` from `alef-codegen` through
  the PHP `trait_bridge` module.
- feat(backend-go): support `bind_via = "options_field"` in `[[trait_bridges]]`.
  When a visitor bridge is configured in options-field mode the Go/cgo backend now:
  - Emits a lightweight `type {Trait} interface` (trait methods only, no plugin lifecycle) in `binding.go`.
  - Injects a synthetic `{Field} {Trait} \`json:"-"\`` field on the Go options struct,
    skipping the raw IR `Option<VisitorHandle>` field so JSON marshaling ignores it.
  - Adds a `WithConversionOptions{Trait}` functional-option constructor.
  - Adds `"runtime/cgo"` to the imports when any options-field bridge is active.
  - In the `Convert` wrapper, after the C options handle is created, checks
    `options.{Field} != nil`, creates a `cgo.NewHandle`, defers `handle.Delete()`,
    and calls `C.{prefix}_options_set_{field}(cOptions, ...)` to pass the visitor to Rust.
  - Does NOT emit a separate `ConvertWithVisitor` function in this mode.
- feat(backend-java): support `bind_via = "options_field"` in `[[trait_bridges]]`.
  When a visitor bridge is configured in options-field mode the Java/Panama FFM backend now:
  - Emits the bridge field as the bridge interface type (e.g. `HtmlVisitor`) annotated with
    `@JsonIgnore` on the `ConversionOptions` record so Jackson excludes it from serialization.
  - Emits a `static final MethodHandle {PU}_OPTIONS_SET_{FIELD}` in `NativeLib.java` using
    `orElse(null)` so class initialization succeeds even when the dylib lacks the symbol.
  - Generates a `convert` wrapper that marshals the options record normally (bridge field is
    skipped by `@JsonIgnore`), then—if both the setter handle and `options.visitor()` are
    non-null—creates the `{Trait}Bridge`, converts it to a `MemorySegment` via `toSegment`,
    and calls the setter before the main FFI invocation.
  - Does NOT emit a standalone `convertWithVisitor` method in this mode.
- feat(backend-magnus): support `bind_via = "options_field"` in `[[trait_bridges]]`.
  When a visitor bridge is configured in options-field mode the Ruby/Magnus backend now:
  - Renders the bridge field as `Option<magnus::Value>` on the binding options struct
    (with `#[serde(skip)]` so JSON round-trips ignore it).
  - Generates a custom `From<BindingOptions> for core::Options` impl that skips the
    bridge field and lets the convert wrapper set it explicitly.
  - Emits a `convert` wrapper (via `gen_bridge_field_function`) that deserializes the
    options hash via `to_json`/`serde_json`, extracts the visitor Ruby object, builds
    `RbHtmlVisitorBridge`, wraps it in `Rc<RefCell<...>>`, and sets it on the core
    options before calling the core function.
  - Does NOT emit a standalone `convert_with_visitor` function.
  Re-exports `find_bridge_field` and `BridgeFieldMatch` from `alef-codegen` through
  the Magnus `trait_bridge` module.

### Fixed

- fix(backend-java): public facade and opaque-type Javadocs now use the shared
  Javadoc escaping path, preventing Rustdoc examples from being emitted as raw
  `&...`/fenced-code content that breaks `mvn verify` Javadoc generation.
- fix(backend-php): generated public PHP wrapper files now include the
  formatter-required blank line after `<?php` before the Alef header, keeping
  `php-cs-fixer` from mutating generated files after hashes are finalized.
- fix(scaffold/java,scaffold/php): generated Java Checkstyle suppressions now
  use a repo-root path in `checkstyle.xml` so both Maven and repo-root
  pre-commit invocations find the suppressions file, and the PHP CS Fixer
  scaffold is itself fixer-clean while still tolerating packages without a
  `tests/` directory.
- fix(cli/format): the default WASM formatter now derives the generated crate
  package from Alef's core crate directory (`core_crate_dir-wasm`) instead of
  the public Rust crate name. This fixes repos where the public crate
  (`tree-sitter-language-pack`) differs from the internal core crate directory
  (`ts-pack-core`), avoiding `cargo fmt -p <missing-crate>` during generation.
- fix(scaffold/generated-output): generated downstream projects now pass common pre-commit checks after trimming a public API surface: Python `options.py` no longer imports native data-enum aliases before redefining their Python-side aliases, Elixir/Ruby Cargo scaffolds omit `async-trait`/`tokio` when no generated code uses them, Java Checkstyle suppressions resolve from both Maven and repo-root hook invocations, PHP CS Fixer tolerates packages without a `tests/` directory, and Rustler `native.ex` target lists are emitted in `mix format` style.
- fix(cli/format): the default Node formatter path now uses the Oxc toolchain (`npx oxfmt .` followed by `npx oxlint --fix .`) instead of invoking Biome. The Node scaffold, lint defaults, and generated pre-commit config already used `oxfmt`/`oxlint`; this removes the remaining stale Biome fallback that `alef all --clean` could hit in downstream repos with vendored Biome configs.
- fix(backend-napi): `gen_dts` now applies the same filtering as `gen_function` (drops names listed in `[node].exclude_functions`, drops `sanitized` functions without a trait_bridge). Previously every public function in the API surface was declared in `index.d.ts`, even when its NAPI binding was filtered out of `lib.rs` because it took a tuple-typed param like `Vec<(Vec<u8>, String, Option<FileExtractionConfig>)>`. The mismatch surfaced as TS2614 / TS2345 in downstream e2e suites that imported the phantom names. The d.ts is now generated from the same filtered set as the lib.rs, keeping the two in lockstep.
- fix(e2e/go): json_object args with `element_type` now emit a Go slice type derived from the element (e.g. `Vec<String>` → `[][]string`). Previously the codegen always declared `var parts []string` regardless of `element_type`, producing `cannot use parts (variable of type []string) as [][]string value` on `kreuzberg.GenerateCacheKey([][]string)` and similar nested-slice signatures.
- fix(backend-java): generate `TestVisitor`, `TestVisitorAdapter`, and `VisitContext` types for visitor-pattern bindings. `TestVisitor` is a test-friendly interface using `VisitContext` (same fields as `NodeContext`) instead of the raw FFI `NodeContext`, and `TestVisitorAdapter` converts `NodeContext` → `VisitContext` before delegating. `VisitResult` gains a `continue_()` alias used by generated e2e tests. `VisitorBridge.encodeVisitResult` now uses `Arena.global()` (not the try-with-resources arena) so allocated buffers survive past the callback return, and calls `.reinterpret(ValueLayout.ADDRESS.byteSize())` before `.set()` on the 0-byte upcall `outCustom`/`outLen` segments. The public facade's `generate_public_api` now forwards `has_visitor_pattern` so `HtmlToMarkdown.convert(html, options, TestVisitor)` is emitted. Trait bridge register/unregister handles in `NativeLib` use `.map(...).orElse(null)` instead of `.orElseThrow()` to avoid `ExceptionInInitializerError` when the symbol is absent.
- fix(e2e/java): `CustomTemplate` actions now extract `{placeholder}` names, convert them to camelCase Java variable names, replace each `{name}` with `%s`, and emit `String.format("fmt", var1, ...)` instead of the unformatted literal. `visit_blockquote`'s `depth` parameter is now `long` (matching the `JAVA_LONG` C layout) instead of `int`. Visitor e2e test files now import `TestVisitor`, `VisitContext`, and `VisitResult` from the binding package when any fixture uses visitor callbacks.
- fix(backend-pyo3): emit `setattr(Cls, "FOO", getattr(Cls, "Bar"))` instead of bare `Cls.FOO = Cls.Bar` when the Rust variant name is a Python keyword. Previously enum variants like `HighlightStyle::None` rendered as `HighlightStyle.NONE = HighlightStyle.None` in `options.py` — `None` is a reserved word, so this produced a `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` at import time, breaking every Python e2e test for any binding whose enum has a `None`/`True`/`False`/etc. variant.
- fix(backend-pyo3): use the python-ident-escaped runtime name in the `getattr` call for keyword-named enum variants. PyO3's `#[pyclass]` enum derive renames variants whose name collides with a Python keyword by appending `_` (e.g. `None` → the runtime attribute is `None_`), so `getattr(HighlightStyle, "None")` raises `AttributeError`. The alias emission now resolves the runtime name via `alef_core::keywords::python_ident` and also triggers the `setattr`/`getattr` form when the SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE alias itself is a Python keyword (e.g. a variant `As` would alias to `AS` which is fine, but `Is` → `IS` and a hypothetical `Continue` → `CONTINUE` are guarded for symmetry).
- fix(e2e/rust): pass visitor arg and unwrap Result for content access. Generated tests now call `convert(html, Some(options), None)` (3-arg form) instead of the stale 2-arg form, emit `.expect("should succeed")` so field access is on the unwrapped `ConversionResult` not on `Result<ConversionResult, ConversionError>`, derive `Debug` on `_TestVisitor` structs (required by the `HtmlVisitor: Debug` bound), import `HtmlVisitor` from the `::visitor` sub-module where it lives, and fix all `HtmlVisitor` method parameter types (e.g. `u8` → `u32` for heading level, `&str` → `Option<&str>` for audio/video/iframe src, `usize` for blockquote depth). `CustomTemplate` actions now bind the referenced parameter identifiers so `format!("{text}")` etc. compile; `Option<&str>` parameters referenced in a template are unwrapped via `let name = name.unwrap_or_default()`. The `alef.toml` Rust override for html-to-markdown gains `wrap_options_in_some = true`, `options_type = "ConversionOptions"`, `extra_args = ["None"]`, and `returns_result = true`.
- fix(e2e/elixir): the e2e mix.exs now uses `[elixir].app_name` as the dep atom (e.g. `:html_to_markdown`), not the crate name with `-` → `_` replacement (e.g. `:html_to_markdown_rs`). When the dep atom doesn't match the path-dep's own `app:` value, mix's resolution silently misroutes — the path-dep's transitive deps (notably `:rustler_precompiled`) are not loaded during compilation of the path-dep itself, and the parent build fails with `(CompileError) cannot compile module ... module RustlerPrecompiled is not loaded and could not be found`.

- fix(backend-php): add `[php].namespace` field to `PhpConfig` that overrides the derived PHP namespace verbatim. Previously the namespace was always derived from `extension_name` by splitting on `_` and converting each segment to PascalCase (e.g. `html_to_markdown` → `Html\To\Markdown`), which was inconsistent with the single-segment `HtmlToMarkdown` namespace expected by `[e2e.call.overrides.php].module`. The new field is used verbatim in class registration (`#[php(name = ...)]`), the PHP facade, type stubs, PSR-4 autoload keys, and e2e test imports — ensuring all four places agree. The three duplicated inline namespace-derivation blocks in `gen_bindings/mod.rs` are collapsed to a single `config.php_autoload_namespace()` call that honors the override.

- fix(backend-extendr): emit `impl From<BindingType> for core::Type` (and the reverse direction) for binding↔core struct and enum conversions, mirroring the existing pyo3/magnus emission paths. Without these, every `*_core: core::Type = binding.into()` site in the generated R lib.rs failed to compile with E0277 unsatisfied trait bounds (e.g. `From<PreprocessingOptions> not implemented for html_to_markdown_rs::PreprocessingOptions`). Lossy `From` impls are now also emitted for data-variant enums, since the extendr binding flattens them to unit variants but containing structs still call `.into()` on the variant value.
- fix(codegen/extendr-kwargs): the `gen_extendr_kwargs_constructor` helper used to emit Rust function-parameter defaults (`name: String = "default"`), which is a syntax error — Rust does not accept default values in function signatures. The constructor now accepts each field as `Option<T>`, instantiates the type via its `Default` impl, and overlays caller-supplied values, producing valid Rust source that the `#[extendr]` macro accepts. Existing `extendr(default = …)` semantics on the R side are preserved by the `generate_public_api` wrapper.
- fix(e2e/c): emit shfmt-compliant case statement style in `download_ffi.sh` so the generated file passes the `shfmt` pre-commit hook without modification and `alef verify` stays consistent.
- fix(e2e/elixir): the e2e mix.exs now uses `[elixir].app_name` as the dep atom (e.g. `:html_to_markdown`), not the crate name with `-` → `_` replacement (e.g. `:html_to_markdown_rs`). When the dep atom doesn't match the path-dep's own `app:` value, mix's resolution silently misroutes — the path-dep's transitive deps (notably `:rustler_precompiled`) are not loaded during compilation of the path-dep itself, and the parent build fails with `(CompileError) cannot compile module ... module RustlerPrecompiled is not loaded and could not be found`. Fixes the elixir e2e suite for any binding whose `[elixir].app_name` differs from the kebab-case crate name.
- fix(e2e/typescript): `options_type` casts and imports are now resolved per-fixture. Previously the renderer used the top-level `[e2e.call.overrides.<lang>].options_type` for every fixture in a test file, even fixtures that overrode the call (`fixture.call = "chunk_text"`) and declared their own per-call `options_type` (e.g. `JsChunkingConfig`). The renderer now reads `e2e.calls.<name>.overrides.<lang>.options_type` for fixtures that override the call, and only the top-level value is used for fixtures using the default call. The header import block emits `type X` declarations for the *union* of all options types referenced by the active fixtures (e.g. both `JsExtractionConfig` and `JsChunkingConfig` when one file mixes `extract_file` and `chunk_text` fixtures), eliminating TS2304 "Cannot find name 'JsChunkingConfig'" on chunking fixtures and stopping the wrong cast (`JsExtractionConfig` applied to a `JsChunkingConfig`-shaped object).
- fix(e2e/typescript): `as <OptionsType>` casts are now emitted only for *object*-shaped json_object args. Previously every json_object arg (including `paths: [...]`, `texts: [...]`, `parts: [...]`) was cast to the call's options type, producing `["a.pdf"] as JsExtractionConfig` on `batchExtractFileSync(paths, config)` calls — TS2352 "Conversion of type 'string[]' to type 'JsExtractionConfig' may be a mistake". The renderer now inspects the fixture value: arrays/scalars are emitted plain (typed as `Array<string>` / etc by the binding), only objects receive the cast.
- fix(e2e/typescript): `bytes` arg type now classifies the fixture string value (file path / inline / base64) and emits a runtime load instead of passing the string as-is. Previously fixtures like `extract_bytes` with `data: "pdf/fake_memo.pdf"` produced `extractBytes("pdf/fake_memo.pdf", ...)` — TS2345 "Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>'". The renderer now classifies via the same rules as python/rust codegens (`<`/`{`/`[`/whitespace → inline-text → `Buffer.from(s, "utf-8")`; `dir/file.ext` → file-path → `readFileSync(path)`; otherwise → base64 → `Buffer.from(s, "base64")`). When any active fixture's resolved call uses a bytes file-path arg, the test file imports `{ readFileSync } from 'node:fs'`. The existing `setup.ts` chdir to `test_documents/` is preserved, so relative paths resolve at runtime.
- fix(e2e/typescript): cast through `unknown` (`as unknown as <Type>`) for both inline configs and the empty-default placeholder. NAPI-RS marks Rust `Option<T>` config params as `T | undefined | null` but bare `T` as required, while the alef.toml `optional` flag does not always match — fixtures like `extract_file_with_no_config` produced calls with no third argument and TS2554 "Expected 3 arguments, but got 2". When the json_object arg is missing (or `null`) and an `options_type` is configured, the renderer now emits `{} as unknown as <Type>` to satisfy the binding's required parameter; partial config literals are also cast through `unknown` to avoid TS2352 "neither type sufficiently overlaps". The runtime binding still validates fields.
- fix(e2e/typescript): `result_is_simple = true` is now honored. Previously the flag was only used by the rust/csharp/java/ruby/r codegens, so fixtures whose binding returns a primitive (e.g. `generateCacheKey: string`, `validateCacheKey: boolean`) emitted `result.<field>` access and triggered TS2339 "Property 'result' does not exist on type 'string'". The TypeScript renderer now resolves the per-call `result_is_simple` flag from `[e2e.calls.<name>.overrides.<lang>]` and (a) uses the bare `result_var` for assertions, (b) skips assertions on non-`result` fields with a `// skipped:` comment.
- fix(e2e/typescript): `arg_order` per-language override is now honored. The flag has been documented in `alef-core` for some time but no codegen reordered the `args` slice — so kreuzberg's `[e2e.call.overrides.node] arg_order = ["path", "config", "mime_type"]` was silently ignored and the renderer emitted args in the canonical Rust order, producing TS2345 "Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'JsExtractionConfig'" on every `extractFile(path, mime, config)` call (NAPI's binding takes `path, config, mime_type?`). The renderer now reorders the per-fixture call args via the language override before passing to `build_args_and_setup`.
- fix(e2e/typescript): per-fixture `options_type` resolution now falls back to the top-level `[e2e.call.overrides.<lang>]` when a per-call override doesn't declare its own. Most kreuzberg per-call entries (e.g. `extract_bytes`) rely on the same `JsExtractionConfig` shape as the default `extract_file` call and therefore intentionally omit the per-call `options_type` — but the prior renderer treated this as "no options_type", emitted no cast, and produced TS2345 on inline config literals. The fallback chain is: per-call `options_type` → top-level `options_type` → no cast.
- fix(e2e/typescript): emit a bare call (no arguments) when the resolved `[e2e.call]` has `args = []` and the fixture has no input. Previously the renderer fell through to `json_to_js(input)` and stringified the entire input object as a single positional arg, producing `listExtractors({})` for `args=[]` calls and triggering TS2554 "Expected 0 arguments, but got 1".
- fix(e2e/typescript): support per-call `result_is_vec = true` by indexing `[0]` into the result variable for field-targeted assertions. Mirrors the existing csharp behavior so fixtures asserting `mime_type` / `content` on `batch_extract_*` calls (which return `Array<JsExtractionResult>`) compile cleanly under strict tsconfig.
- fix(e2e/typescript+wasm): honor per-call `skip_languages` when filtering active fixtures. The CallConfig field has been documented in alef-core for some time but no codegen consulted it — so kreuzberg's `[e2e.calls.batch_extract_*] skip_languages = ["wasm"]` was silently ignored and the wasm renderer emitted test files importing `batchExtractBytesSync` etc. that the wasm binding doesn't export, producing TS2614 / TS2724. Both the typescript (node) and wasm renderers now drop fixtures whose resolved call's `skip_languages` contains the target language.
- fix(e2e/typescript): `not_empty` / `is_empty` on non-array fields no longer emits `.length`. The renderer cannot statically know whether a struct field (e.g. `metadata` on JsExtractionResult — type `JsMetadata`) is a string or an object, so it now emits a runtime IIFE that branches on `typeof v === 'string' || Array.isArray(v)` (uses `v.length`) vs object (uses `Object.keys(v).length`). Casting through `unknown` avoids TS narrowing the unreachable branch to `never`. Behavior on array fields (declared in `fields_array`) is unchanged.
- fix(e2e/typescript): `has_later_arg_value` now also returns true for optional `json_object` args with `options_type` configured, since those emit a typed `{} as unknown as <Type>` placeholder. Previously a fixture with only `path` set (no `mime_type`, no `config`) on a 3-arg `extractFile(path, mime_type?, config)` produced `extractFile(path, {})` (2 args), tripping TS2554 against the wasm signature `extractFile(path, mime_type, config)`. The fix makes preceding optional args emit `undefined` placeholders so positional order is preserved.

### Changed

- feat(e2e/codegen): result-shape flags (`result_is_simple`, `result_is_vec`, `result_is_array`, `result_is_bytes`, `result_is_option`) are now read from the call-level `[e2e.calls.<n>]` (and the default `[e2e.call]`) in addition to per-language overrides. The rust, csharp, ruby, r, and typescript codegens all OR the call-level value with their per-language override, so a single call-level declaration applies consistently to every binding (return-type shape is a property of the Rust core function, not of any binding). Per-language overrides remain accepted for backwards compatibility but are no longer required.

### Changed

- feat(core/config): `result_is_simple`, `result_is_vec`, `result_is_array`, `result_is_bytes`, and `result_is_option` are now first-class fields of `CallConfig` itself, not only `CallOverride`. These flags describe the Rust core's return type and therefore apply identically to every binding — declaring them at call level eliminates the need for redundant per-language `[e2e.calls.<n>.overrides.<lang>] result_is_simple = true` blocks (kreuzberg's alef.toml had ~30 such call entries duplicated across rust/node/csharp/java/python/wasm). The typescript codegen now ORs the call-level value with the per-language override to preserve backwards compatibility; other backends will adopt the same pattern in subsequent releases. Per-language overrides remain accepted but should be removed in favor of the call-level field.

## [0.13.6] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- feat(scaffold): manage workspace `.cargo/config.toml` via opt-in `[scaffold.cargo]` section in `alef.toml`. When the section is present, alef writes the full canonical file with hash-based drift detection (same `# alef:hash:` pattern as other alef-managed files). Default config produces a 6-target template covering macOS dynamic_lookup (required for PyO3/ext-php-rs cdylibs to link on macOS — the symptom is `ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64` on `_zend_*`/`ext_php_rs::zend::*` and PyO3 symbols at runtime since macOS ld is strict and these symbols are resolved at extension-load time, not link time), Windows MSVC `rust-lld` for x86_64 + i686, `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` for ARM64 Linux cross-compile, `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` for static Linux, and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` bulk-memory + getrandom_backend cfg. Per-target opt-out via `[scaffold.cargo.targets]`; repo-specific `[env]` entries via `[scaffold.cargo.env]` (supports both bare strings and `{ value, relative }` form). When `[scaffold.cargo]` is absent, the legacy create-if-missing wasm32-only behavior is preserved unchanged. New types in `alef-core::config`: `ScaffoldCargo`, `ScaffoldCargoTargets`, `ScaffoldCargoEnvValue`. New public function `alef_scaffold::render_cargo_config(&ScaffoldCargo) -> String` for deterministic rendering, with 11 unit tests covering golden output, env injection, per-target opt-out, deterministic re-render, key sorting, escaping, and the legacy-fallback gate.

### Added

- feat(e2e/elixir,e2e/gleam): migrate the BEAM languages onto the shared `TestClientRenderer` + `render_http_test` driver, completing Phase 2B. Elixir defines an `ElixirTestClientRenderer<'a>` (carrying `fixture_id` and `expected_status` so `render_call` can build `/fixtures/<id>` URLs and disable Req's auto-redirect for 3xx fixtures) implementing all 8 trait methods; the `FINCH_UNSUPPORTED_METHODS` (TRACE/CONNECT) skip stub stays as a thin pre-hook before delegating to the shared driver. Gleam defines a unit `GleamTestClientRenderer` whose `render_call` uses `gleam_httpc` and whose `render_assert_partial_body` / `render_assert_validation_errors` use `string.contains` (Gleam's stdlib has no JSON decoder); the renderer also overrides `sanitize_test_name` to strip leading `_`/digits so gleeunit names are valid Gleam identifiers. Behavioral notes: elixir's `describe`/`test` labels are now `(fixture_id, description)` rather than `("METHOD PATH - description", "")`, matching all reference impls (cosmetic only); both languages now emit `body_partial`/`validation_errors` assertions when fixtures carry them (old monoliths never called these); WASM was already routing through the migrated TypeScript renderer and required no changes.
- feat(e2e/go,e2e/java,e2e/csharp,e2e/kotlin): migrate the JVM/Go/.NET languages onto the shared `TestClientRenderer` + `render_http_test` driver. These languages cannot expose the consumer's `TestClient` cleanly via FFI, so they continue to drive the binding's `App.serve()` over a TCP-loopback `baseUrl` env var, but the per-test rendering now goes through the shared driver. Per-language deltas: go now unconditionally emits `_ = bodyBytes` to silence the unused-var compile error on tests with no body assertion (the old monolith conditionally omitted `io.ReadAll`); java/kotlin/csharp now correctly emit `<<present>>`/`<<absent>>`/`<<uuid>>` header-token assertions (old code silently skipped them); java now appends query params to the URI string (old code never handled query params); kotlin/go/csharp now sort headers and cookies for deterministic output (old code used HashMap insertion order); go/kotlin/csharp/java now also emit `body_partial` and `validation_errors` assertions when fixtures carry them (old monoliths never called these).
- feat(e2e/php,e2e/dart,e2e/swift,e2e/zig): migrate the second batch of TestClient-friendly languages (php, dart, swift, zig) onto the shared `TestClientRenderer` + `render_http_test` driver. Each language now defines a `<Lang>TestClientRenderer` struct + `impl client::TestClientRenderer` capturing only the language-native primitives (PHPUnit `public function test*(): void` + Guzzle, Dart `test('...', () async {})` over `dart:io`, XCTest `func testFoo() throws` over `URLSession`, Zig `test "..."` over `std.http.Client`). Per-language deltas: php now emits validation-error assertions even when the fixture also has a `body` (the old gate suppressed them); dart's `DartTestClientRenderer` carries a small `Cell<bool>` for `is_redirect` + `in_skip` because `CallCtx` doesn't carry expected-status; swift binds `_resp`/`_responseData` in `render_call` and references those names from subsequent assertion methods (matching the synchronous-via-DispatchSemaphore wrapper); zig's `render_assert_header` and `render_assert_partial_body`/`render_assert_validation_errors` are stubs (Zig's stdlib HTTP client doesn't expose response headers from `client.fetch(...)` results — same TODO pattern already used for `method_result`/`matches_regex` in the file).
- feat(e2e/python,e2e/typescript,e2e/ruby,e2e/rust): migrate the four pilot languages (python, typescript/node, ruby, rust) onto the shared `TestClientRenderer` + `render_http_test` driver. Each language now defines a small `<Lang>TestClientRenderer` struct + `impl client::TestClientRenderer` capturing only the language-native primitives (`def test_X(client):` / `it(...)` / RSpec `it` block / `#[tokio::test] async fn`); the canonical sequence (open → call → status → headers → body → validation → close), header sorting, content-encoding stripping, skip-directive handling, and `null`/empty-string body sentinels are now driven once from the shared driver. The four files `crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/{python,typescript,ruby,rust}.rs` lose ~145-line monolithic HTTP-test renderers in favor of trait impls, leaving `render_http_test_function` (or equivalent) as a thin pre-hook + delegate to `client::http_call::render_http_test`. Behavioral notes: rust now also emits body/header/validation assertions from the shared driver (previous code only asserted status); typescript request headers are now emitted in deterministic sorted order rather than HashMap insertion order; python's one fixture with both `body` and `validation_errors` (`content_type_validation_invalid_type`) now emits both assertions instead of suppressing the latter (the validation assertion is a strict subset of the body equality, so no false failures).
- feat(e2e): shared `TestClientRenderer` trait and `render_http_test` driver in `crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/client/`. Per-language e2e codegen previously duplicated the structural shape of every HTTP test (function header, request build, status/header/body assertions) across 18 monolithic per-language files (359-2965 lines each); the shape only differed in syntax. The new `client::TestClientRenderer` trait captures the canonical sequence — `render_test_open` → `render_call` → `render_assert_status` → per-header `render_assert_header` → `render_assert_json_body` / `render_assert_partial_body` → `render_assert_validation_errors` → `render_test_close` — and the shared `client::http_call::render_http_test` driver invokes those primitives in order, with built-in handling of skip directives, content-encoding header stripping, deterministic header ordering, and the `null`/empty-string body sentinels. Languages migrate one at a time: each implements the trait, replaces its monolithic `render_http_test_function` with a one-line call to the shared driver, and may optionally split its file into a `<lang>/{mod,client,ws,helpers}.rs` directory. 9 new unit tests use a tag-emitting mock renderer to lock down the driver's call sequence and special-case handling. A companion `client::ws_script::WebSocketScriptRenderer` trait is stubbed out for Phase 2B/2C.

### Changed

- chore: scrub library-specific terminology from alef source comments, doc-strings, test fixtures, and skill references. alef is a generic polyglot bindgen tool used by multiple downstream consumer libraries; comments, examples, and test fixture data that previously named one specific consumer ("spikard", `dev.spikard`, `:spikard`, etc.) are renamed to neutral placeholders (`mylib`, `mylib-core`, `consumer_core`, `com.example`, `:mylib`, `MyHandler`). Changes are limited to documentation/test data — no production code logic or generator output is affected. Historical published `## [0.x.y]` CHANGELOG entries are intentionally not rewritten (they describe shipped releases).
- fix(adapters/pyo3): callback-bridge codegen for Python no longer emits hardcoded `prepare_request`/`interpret_response` stub methods referencing a specific consumer's `handler_trait::RequestData` type. The stubs were dead code (always returning `Err(...)` "not implemented") that imposed a 3-method trait shape on every consumer; other language bridges (Node, Ruby, PHP, ...) only implement the user-defined method and were already correct. The Python branch now matches that pattern. If a consumer's actual trait requires additional methods, they must declare default impls in their trait definition or extend the AdapterConfig schema.

### Fixed

- fix(taskfile): `task set-version` now also bumps the workspace `alef.toml` (alef dogfoods its own config). Also switched from BSD-only `sed -i ''` to portable `sed -i.bak ... && rm -f` so the task works on Linux CI as well as macOS.
- fix(scaffold/node): emit `index.d.ts` at the package root in addition to `src/index.d.ts`. The generated `package.json` declares `"types": "index.d.ts"` (and lists `"index.d.ts"` in `files`), but the scaffold previously only emitted the type-shim under `packages/{node}/src/`, leaving the npm package without discoverable declarations at the path consumers actually resolve. Downstream `import 'kreuzberg'` (or any other alef-managed npm package) typed under the strict tsconfig produced `TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'kreuzberg'` and degraded to implicit `any`, propagating to every test/file that referenced binding-emitted types like `JsExtractionConfig`. The fix emits both copies — the `src/` copy is preserved for in-tree tsconfig "include": ["src"] tooling; the new root copy is what npm exposes via `package.json#types`. Scaffold tests updated to assert both files are present (file count rises from 7 → 8 in `test_scaffold_node` and 10 → 11 in `test_scaffold_multiple`).
- fix(backend/pyo3): correct `Arc<T: !Copy>` field codegen for clone. When a struct field had type `Option<Arc<serde_json::Value>>` (or any non-String `Arc`-wrapped type), the core→binding `From` impl chained an extra `.map(|v| (*v).clone().into())` on top of a base conversion that already handled the `Option<Arc<T>>` via Display/Deref coercion (e.g. `val.X.as_ref().map(ToString::to_string)`). This produced `(*String).clone()` at the call site — dereferencing a `String` to `str`, then calling `str::clone()` which fails since `str: !Clone`. The fix detects when the base conversion is already a complex expression (not a simple `val.{name}` passthrough) and returns it unchanged, relying on `Arc<T>: Display + Deref<Target=T>` to correctly produce the binding-side value.
- fix(backend/pyo3): emit `Arc<tokio::sync::Mutex<T>>` (instead of `Arc<std::sync::Mutex<T>>`) for opaque types whose `&mut self` methods are all `async`. `std::sync::MutexGuard` is `!Send`, so holding a guard across `.await` makes the surrounding future `!Send`, which fails to compile against PyO3's `Send` future bound on `pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::future_into_py`. `tokio::sync::MutexGuard` IS `Send`. New helper `alef_codegen::generators::type_needs_tokio_mutex` returns true only when every `&mut self` method on a mutex-needing type is async (mixed sync+async `&mut self` methods stay on `std::sync::Mutex` since `tokio::sync::Mutex::lock()` returns a future). The PyO3 backend rewrites the rendered struct + impl block to swap the lock type and `.lock().unwrap()` → `.lock().await` for these types. Verified end-to-end against an opaque type wrapping `axum-test`'s `TestWebSocket` in `Arc<Mutex<>>` with all-async `&mut self` methods: with the previously-required exclusions removed from `alef.toml`, the consumer's PyO3 cdylib compiles cleanly and the generated future satisfies the `Send` bound.
- fix(e2e/rust): rust e2e codegen now honors `owned = true` on `bytes` and `string` arg configs. Pre-this-change the renderer always emitted `&{name}` for bytes (via `.as_bytes()`) and a bare `&str` literal for string, regardless of whether the underlying kreuzberg-core function took the value by reference or by ownership (e.g. `detect_image_format(data: Vec<u8>)`, `detect_mime_type(path: String, ...)`). The codegen now flips both binding type (`Some(...).to_vec()` / `String::new()`) and pass expression (`name.to_string()` / `name.to_vec()` / `name`) when `owned = true`, so call sites match the function signature without forcing every owned-by-value Rust API into a borrowed wrapper. Two regression tests added in `crates/alef-e2e/tests/rust_function_call_fixtures.rs` (owned bytes file-path, owned string).
- fix(backend-magnus): functions registered via the trait_bridge path now use fixed arity in `function!(...)` instead of `-1` (variadic). The bridge generator emits a fixed-arg signature like `fn convert(html: String, options: Option<String>, visitor: Option<Value>)`, but the registration loop previously emitted `function!(convert, -1)` whenever any param was optional. Magnus's `function!` macro requires the fn to take `&[Value]` for arity `-1`, so the trait-bridge fn failed to satisfy `FunctionCAry<_>`/`Fn<(&[Value],)>`, breaking compilation for every binding that exposed a top-level function with an `HtmlVisitor`-style trait param (e.g. `html-to-markdown`'s ruby gem failed to build on linux/aarch64/macos with E0599 "method `call_handle_error` exists but trait bounds were not satisfied"). Bridge functions now register with `function!(name, params.len())`; non-bridge optional-param functions still use variadic `-1` with `scan_args` as before.

## [0.13.5] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/rust): rust e2e codegen no longer short-circuits all non-HTTP, non-mock-server fixtures to a `// TODO: implement when a callable API is available` stub. Pre-0.13.5 the renderer assumed any fixture without an `http` block or a `mock_response` was a schema/spec validation fixture (asyncapi/grpc/graphql_schema) with no callable Rust API, so libraries whose fixtures invoke a plain function (e.g. `kreuzberg::extract_file(path, mime, config)`) emitted zero real test bodies. The stub gate now triggers only when the resolved call config has no function name; fixtures pointing at a configured `[e2e.call]` (or `[e2e.calls.<n>]`) render real function invocations with the right imports.
- fix(e2e/rust): `use {crate}::{fn};` import lines are now emitted for any non-HTTP fixture whose resolved call config has a function name, not only `mock_response`-bearing fixtures. Previously plain function-call fixtures rendered the call site but omitted the `use` line, producing E0425 "cannot find function" on every test.
- fix(e2e/rust): `bytes` arguments whose fixture value is a relative file path (e.g. `"pdf/fake_memo.pdf"`, classified the same way as in the python codegen) are now loaded at runtime via `std::fs::read(concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/../../test_documents/", "<path>")).expect(...)` and passed by reference. Previously the path string itself was embedded as `r#"…"#` and `.as_bytes()`-ed, which compiled but always passed the path text as the file contents.

## [0.13.4] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- feat(e2e/wasm): the wasm e2e codegen now emits real `extractFile`/`extractBytes`-style test cases for non-HTTP fixtures, not just HTTP-server fixtures. Pre-0.13.4 the wasm renderer filtered `f.http.is_some()` and dropped every function-call fixture, leaving `e2e/wasm/` with only `globalSetup.ts`+`package.json` and zero tests against the binding's core async API. The wasm codegen now reuses the typescript renderer (parameterised by `lang = "wasm"`) and emits a `setup.ts` chdir to `test_documents/` when any active fixture takes a `file_path` or `bytes` arg, plus `globalSetup.ts` only when at least one HTTP fixture is in scope. Function-call resolution now goes through `[e2e.calls.<name>.overrides.wasm]` (auto-camelCasing the rust snake_case name when no explicit override is set), so wasm-specific renames work the same way they do for node.

### Changed

- chore(codegen): `resolve_node_function_name` (in `alef-e2e::codegen::typescript`) now takes a `lang: &str` parameter so the wasm codegen can reuse it. Existing call sites unaffected — typescript codegen passes `"node"` and behaves identically.

## [0.13.3] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- fix(backend/php): always emit `#![cfg_attr(windows, feature(abi_vectorcall))]`
  in the generated PHP binding lib.rs. ext-php-rs requires the `vectorcall`
  calling convention for PHP entry points on Windows, but the generator
  previously only emitted the cfg_attr when `[php].feature_gate` was set.
  Without it, downstream crates fail with E0658 ("the extern \"vectorcall\"
  ABI is experimental"). The cfg_attr is a no-op on non-windows so it costs
  nothing on Linux/macOS builds.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- fix(publish/php): use `[php].extension_name` (composer.json's `php-ext.extension-name`)
  for PIE archive filenames and inner `.so`/`.dll` name, not the binding crate name. PIE
  installs binaries by extension-name, so `package_php` previously emitted
  `php_{crate}_php-...` archives that PIE couldn't find. Cargo's compiled artifact filename
  (still based on the crate name with `-php` suffix) is now resolved separately and renamed
  to `{ext_name}.so` / `{ext_name}.dll` inside the archive.

- fix(backend/ffi): honor `[ffi] exclude_types` in generated lib.rs. Previously the `FfiConfig::exclude_types`
  field was parsed from `alef.toml` but never applied during code generation — all types in the API surface
  were emitted regardless. The FFI backend now filters `api.types` through `ffi_exclude_types` before emitting
  struct wrappers, field accessors, and method wrappers, matching the behavior of the elixir and wasm backends.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- fix(cli/e2e): `alef e2e generate` now sweeps orphan alef-generated files left under the e2e (and `--registry` test_apps) output root when a category or fixture leaves the generation set (e.g. all fixtures in a category resolve to skipped for the active binding surface, or wasm fixture-filtering drops a file). Previously these files lingered on disk with stale `alef:hash:` headers and `alef verify --exit-code` reported them as stale forever, blocking pre-commit hooks even after a clean regen. The sweep only deletes files whose first 10 lines contain the `auto-generated by alef` marker, so user-owned fixtures, scaffolded manifests, and lockfiles are never touched. Dependency directories (`target`, `node_modules`, `_build`, `vendor`, `deps`, `.venv`, `build`, `dist`, `.git`, `Pods`) are skipped during the walk.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-05-01

### Changed (BREAKING)

- feat(publish/php): `alef publish package --lang php` now produces PIE-conventional archives.
  Filename: `php_{ext}-{ver}_php{phpVer}-{arch}-{os}-{libc}-{ts}.tgz` (Unix) /
  `php_{ext}-{ver}-{phpVer}-{ts}-{compiler}-{arch}.zip` (Windows).
  Archive contains only `{ext_name}.so`/`.dll` at the archive root — no `composer.json`,
  `pie.json`, `INSTALL.md`, or `ext/` subdirectory. Requires new flags:
  `--php-version` (required), `--php-ts` (default `nts`), `--php-libc` (auto-detected),
  `--windows-compiler` (required on Windows targets). A SHA-256 sidecar
  `{archive}.sha256` is always written alongside the archive.

### Added

- feat(template-versions): `ENVOY_VERSION_RANGE` for the `envoy` Hex package — used by gleam e2e tests to read `MOCK_SERVER_URL` since neither `gleam_stdlib` nor `gleam_erlang` expose env-var access.
- feat(e2e/gleam): inject `gleam_http` as a direct dep and emit `import gleam/result` so generated tests can compile under gleam_stdlib >= 1.0.

### Fixed

- fix(codegen/conversions): preserve `Some(...)` wrap when the binding optionalizes a non-optional core field of type `Cow<'_, str>` (e.g. NAPI `optionalize_defaults`); previously the Cow `to_string()` branch dropped the upstream `Some(...)` wrap, producing `String` where `Option<String>` was required and breaking compile of NAPI bindings whose core type holds `Cow<'static, str>` (`ArchiveMetadata.format`, `ExtractionResult.mime_type`)
- fix(e2e/wasm): drop non-HTTP fixtures, fixtures with a literal `Content-Length` header, and fixtures using TRACE/CONNECT before code generation; node `fetch` (undici) rejects pre-set Content-Length and disallows TRACE/CONNECT, and empty `describe(...)` blocks fail vitest

- fix(e2e/elixir): emit a `@tag :skip` ExUnit test for non-HTTP non-`mock_response` fixtures (AsyncAPI, WebSocket, OpenRPC schema-only) so generated suites compile without referencing a non-existent binding `handle_request`/`handle_request_async` callable.
- fix(e2e/elixir): drop `content-encoding` and `connection` from generated header assertions — Req auto-decompresses gzip/brotli responses and strips the encoding header, and `connection` is a hop-by-hop header stripped by the response pipeline.
- fix(e2e/gleam): import `gleam/httpc` (not the package name `gleam_httpc`) and call `httpc.send/1`; the previous import path produced "unknown module" errors at compile time.
- fix(e2e/gleam): replace `gleam/os.get_env` (removed from gleam_stdlib >= 1.0) with `envoy.get/1` for `MOCK_SERVER_URL` lookup.
- fix(e2e/gleam): annotate the `list.find` predicate with `fn(h: #(String, String))` so the gleam type checker can resolve tuple field access on `resp.headers`.
- fix(e2e/gleam): use `result.is_ok` (not `option.is_some`) for header-presence assertions — `list.find` returns `Result(a, Nil)`, not an Option.
- fix(e2e/gleam): strip leading underscores/digits from HTTP test function names so numeric-prefixed fixture IDs (`13_json_with_charset_utf16`) produce valid gleam identifiers.
- fix(e2e/gleam): always emit the `e2e_gleam_test.gleam` entry module so `gleam test` discovers the per-category test files.
- fix(e2e/gleam): drop WebSocket-upgrade fixtures (request advertises `Upgrade: websocket`) — gleam_httpc cannot follow HTTP/1.1 protocol upgrades and errors with `ResponseTimeout`.
- fix(e2e/wasm): drop non-HTTP fixtures, fixtures with a pre-set `Content-Length` header, and fixtures using `TRACE`/`CONNECT` methods — node's undici fetch rejects the first two and refuses to dispatch the latter.

## [0.12.16] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- feat(backend-csharp,core): support `[languages.csharp.exclude_functions]` to skip generating selected free functions from the C# binding surface
- feat(backend-java): emit `JsonInclude(NON_NULL)` on optional fields and `JsonInclude(NON_ABSENT)` at the class level so Jackson omits null/empty optionals when serializing Java DTOs across the FFI boundary
- feat(backend-java): wrap optional FFI parameters as `TypeRef::Optional` for null-safety; non-zero integer defaults emit a compact constructor that initializes them when callers pass null

### Fixed

- fix(backend-magnus): use variadic arity (-1) with `scan_args` for free functions that have optional or promoted parameters; previously such functions were registered with a fixed arity equal to the total parameter count, causing Ruby callers that omit trailing optional arguments to get an argument count error
- fix(e2e/ruby): emit `nil` placeholder for skipped optional positional args when a later arg is present; previously omitting an optional String arg before a json_object arg produced a 2-arg call where the config object landed in the string slot, causing a `TypeError: no implicit conversion` runtime error
- fix(e2e/elixir): add kreuzberg path dep and rustler direct dep to generated mix.exs so NIF force-build works in e2e tests
- fix(e2e/elixir): replace `map_or(false, ...)` with `is_some_and(...)` to clear `clippy::unnecessary_map_or`
- fix(e2e/java): set `workingDirectory` in the generated maven-surefire plugin block so tests run from the project basedir, fixing relative fixture path resolution
- fix(backend-extendr): derive R wrapper output path as packages/r/R/ instead of packages/r/src/rust/src/
- fix(backend-pyo3): emit `pass` body for empty structs that pass through the codegen; combined with the v0.12.15 fix this allows empty structs to be referenced in tagged-union aliases without import-time `NameError`
- fix(backend-ffi): preserve numeric error code metadata on the FFI error type through the type generators so host-side error conversions can attach `code`/`message` consistently
- fix(scaffold/r): include `<R_ext/Visibility.h>` in generated entrypoint.c to define `attribute_visible`
- fix(scaffold/php): align scaffolded PHP package metadata and dev tooling with current backend expectations
- fix(cli/extract): drop debug `eprintln` from the extract pipeline so generation output is no longer polluted on stderr
- fix(e2e/go): include `mock_response` in unit-test fixture builder so `test_go_method_name_uses_go_casing` exercises the real codegen path instead of the non-HTTP skip stub
- fix(e2e/rust): include `mock_response` in unit-test fixture builders so `rust_call_overrides` regression tests exercise the real codegen path
- fix(scaffold): assert on `config.ext_dir = 'native'` (the current `rb_sys/mkmf` API) instead of the deprecated `cargo_manifest` form

## [0.12.15] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- fix(backend-pyo3): emit empty Python dataclasses for empty Rust structs (e.g. `pub struct ExcelMetadata {}`) when they have `Default`. Previously, the codegen skipped them entirely, leaving dangling references in tagged-union type aliases (`FormatMetadata = ... | ExcelMetadata | ...`) and breaking module import with `NameError: name 'ExcelMetadata' is not defined`.
- fix(e2e/escape): escape ASCII control characters (`\x00`–`\x1f`) in Python string literals using `\xHH` so generated Python source remains valid. Previously, fixtures with embedded NUL bytes (e.g. `clean_text_basic`) produced source files Python's parser rejected with `SyntaxError: source code string cannot contain null bytes`.
- fix(e2e/csharp): use PascalCase HTTP method names for `System.Net.Http.HttpMethod` static properties; route header assertions to `.Headers` vs `.Content.Headers` correctly to avoid "Misused header name" runtime errors; uniquify per-assertion variable names so `out var` does not redeclare in method scope.
- fix(e2e/go): clarify the non-HTTP stub message and document why it fires (Go bindings without a callable matching `[e2e.call].function`).
- fix(e2e/go): emit `os` import when any HTTP fixture is present (HTTP tests read `MOCK_SERVER_URL` via `os.Getenv`); previously only mock_url args triggered the import.
- fix(e2e/go): only emit `io` import when at least one HTTP fixture has a body assertion; eliminates `"io" imported and not used` build errors in test files where no fixture asserts on the body.
- fix(e2e/go): only declare `bodyBytes` when the fixture has a body assertion; eliminates `declared and not used: bodyBytes` build errors.
- fix(e2e/go): use a separate `want :=` declaration plus `%q` formatting in the body-mismatch `t.Fatalf` instead of interpolating the (already-Go-quoted) literal into the format string; previously emitted unparsable Go for fixtures whose expected body contained double-quotes (e.g. JSON-as-string responses) and for headers whose names/values contained backticks.
- fix(e2e/go): decode HTTP response and expected bodies into `any` (not `map[string]any`) so JSON arrays in the expected body decode without `cannot unmarshal array into ... map` runtime errors.

## [0.12.14] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/rust): translate synthetic assertion fields (`embeddings`, `embedding_dimensions`, `embeddings_valid`, `embeddings_finite`, `embeddings_non_zero`, `embeddings_normalized`, `chunks_have_embeddings`, `keywords`, `keywords_count`) to correct Rust expressions instead of treating them as struct field accesses; `keywords`/`keywords_count` map to `extracted_keywords` on `ExtractionResult`.
- fix(e2e/python): intercept synthetic embedding and keyword assertion fields before struct field emission; skip `keywords`/`keywords_count` (no Python binding for `extracted_keywords`).
- fix(e2e/typescript): intercept synthetic embedding and keyword assertion fields; emit Vitest `expect` assertions using array methods; skip `keywords`/`keywords_count`.
- fix(e2e/go): intercept synthetic embedding and keyword assertion fields; emit inline immediately-invoked functions for predicate checks on `*[][]float32`; skip `keywords`/`keywords_count`.
- fix(e2e/ruby): intercept synthetic embedding and keyword assertion fields in the binding assertion path; emit RSpec `expect` assertions using Ruby enumerable methods; skip `keywords`/`keywords_count`.
- fix(e2e/php): intercept synthetic embedding and keyword assertion fields; emit PHPUnit assertions using `array_reduce`/`array_filter`; skip `keywords`/`keywords_count`.
- fix(e2e/csharp): intercept synthetic embedding and keyword assertion fields; emit xUnit assertions using LINQ; skip `keywords`/`keywords_count`.
- fix(e2e/elixir): intercept synthetic embedding and keyword assertion fields; emit ExUnit assertions using `Enum` functions; skip `keywords`/`keywords_count`.
- fix(e2e/r): intercept synthetic embedding and keyword assertion fields; emit testthat `expect_*` assertions using `sapply`/`all`; skip `keywords`/`keywords_count`.
- fix(e2e/wasm): intercept synthetic embedding and keyword assertion fields (defensive, embed is WASM-skipped); skip `keywords`/`keywords_count`.
- fix(e2e/ruby): use title-cased `Net::HTTP` request class names (`Delete`, `Head`, `Patch`, `Put`) instead of all-caps variants that don't exist in Ruby's stdlib; skip `content-encoding` header assertions; handle plain-string and empty bodies correctly; skip HTTP 101 WebSocket upgrade tests; emit `skip` stubs for non-HTTP fixtures (WebSocket, SSE) that cannot be tested via Net::HTTP; avoid `JSON.parse(nil)` on 204 No Content responses; deduplicate `Content-Type` header when body is already set.
- fix(backend-magnus): use `.to_vec()` instead of `.into()` when wrapping `&Bytes` return values from non-opaque struct methods; `Vec<u8>: From<&Bytes>` is not implemented so `.into()` failed to compile for methods like `as_bytes()` on `UploadFile`.
- fix(e2e/gleam): filter out HTTP-type fixtures and call-based fixtures without a Gleam-specific override; emit a `src/` placeholder module (required by the Gleam toolchain) and a smoke test when no fixture-driven tests are generated; strip leading digits from test function names.
- fix(e2e/kotlin): generate proper `java.net.http.HttpClient` HTTP tests for all 559 HTTP fixtures; hit `MOCK_SERVER_URL/fixtures/<id>` per the mock server protocol; URL-encode query params at runtime to handle JSON array values; escape `$` in string literals to prevent Kotlin string interpolation; skip Java's restricted headers (`Connection`, `Content-Length`, `Expect`, `Host`, `Upgrade`); skip `content-encoding` header assertions (mock server doesn't compress); skip 101 status tests (Java HttpClient doesn't handle protocol upgrades); emit `assumeTrue(false)` stubs for non-HTTP fixtures without a Kotlin-specific call override; add `kotlin("test")` to build.gradle.kts dependencies.
- fix(escape): add `escape_kotlin` function that escapes `$` in addition to standard Java escapes to prevent Kotlin string interpolation on embedded values.

## [0.12.13] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- fix(extract): `validate_call_export` now accepts method-on-type references (e.g., `function = "chat"` where `chat` is a method on a public type). Previously rejected legitimate method-style entry points used by `liter-llm` and similar libraries.

## [0.12.12] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- fix(codegen/binding_helpers): apply `k.into()` to Map keys in `gen_lossy_binding_to_core_fields` so the binding-side `is_empty()` helper round-trips wrapped string keys (`Cow`, `Box<str>`, `Arc<str>`) correctly. Previously the helper emitted `(k, …)` directly, which broke when the core key type was `AHashMap<Cow<'static, str>, Value>`.
- fix(backend-wasm): also deserialize `Vec<Vec<T>>` parameters in the `can_delegate` branch via `serde_wasm_bindgen::from_value`. Previously only the Result-returning serde-recovery branch handled this, so non-Result functions like `generate_cache_key` received the raw `JsValue`.
- fix(codegen/binding_to_core): emit `k.into()` for non-Json keys in the generic `Map` arm, completing the Cow-key round-trip fix.

### Changed

- feat(e2e/go): emit `t.Skip("TODO: ...")` stubs for all fixtures that lack a `mock_response`; omit the package import when no test uses it to avoid the Go "imported and not used" compile error.
- feat(e2e/java): emit `Assumptions.assumeTrue(false, "TODO: ...")` stubs for all fixtures that lack a `mock_response` so the test class compiles and is skipped cleanly.
- feat(e2e/csharp): emit `[Fact(Skip = "TODO: ...")]` stubs for all fixtures that lack a `mock_response` so the test class compiles and all tests are reported as skipped.
- fix(e2e/php): skip JSON decode and body assertions when `expected_response.body` is the empty-string sentinel, avoiding `JsonException` on empty bodies.
- fix(e2e/php): skip `markTestSkipped` for non-HTTP fixtures with no assertions; add `allow_redirects => false` to Guzzle client; skip HTTP 101 WebSocket upgrade tests; handle plain-string response bodies with raw `(string)$response->getBody()` comparison; suppress redundant `validation_errors` assertions when a full `body` assertEquals is generated; skip `content-encoding` header assertions since the mock server always returns uncompressed bodies.
- fix(e2e/rust): handle `<<absent>>` sentinel by omitting that header from mock responses; handle `<<uuid>>` sentinel by generating a real UUID v4 value; use `text/plain` default content-type when body is not JSON.
- fix(e2e/python): skip content-encoding assertions; handle plain-string and empty/null bodies without json.loads; skip HTTP 101 tests; disable redirect following; fix validation errors field name ("errors" not "detail").
- fix(e2e/typescript): skip content-encoding assertions; handle plain-string and empty/null bodies; skip HTTP 101 tests; add redirect: 'manual'; suppress import when no-assertion non-HTTP fixtures; emit it.skip stubs; fix validation errors field name.

## [0.12.11] - 2026-05-01

### Changed

- feat(e2e/swift): emit test files into `packages/swift/Tests/<Module>Tests/` instead of a standalone `e2e/swift` package. SwiftPM 6.0 forbids local `.package(path:)` references between packages in the same git repository; placing the generated tests inside the existing library package sidesteps the restriction while retaining a skeletal `e2e/swift/Package.swift` for CI reference.
- feat(e2e/zig): use `std.heap.DebugAllocator(.{}) = .init` (Zig 0.16+); emit compilable stub test bodies (`_ = testing;`) for fixtures with no assertions instead of calling a non-existent `handle_request` function; omit allocator setup when no setup lines are needed.
- feat(scaffold/swift): upgrade generated `Package.swift` to `swift-tools-version: 6.0`; remove `unsafeFlags` from `RustBridge` target's `linkerSettings` so the package can be used as a SwiftPM dependency.

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/rust/tests): pass the new `needs_http_tests` flag through `cargo_toml_generation.rs` test fixtures so the suite compiles after the `render_cargo_toml` signature was extended.
- fix(codegen/conversions): emit `k.to_string()` for Map keys in core→binding conversion and `k.into()` for the reverse direction so `Cow<'_, str>`/`Box<str>`/`Arc<str>` keys (which the type resolver normalizes to `TypeRef::String`) round-trip correctly. Without this fix the generated `From` impls produced `(Cow<'_, str>, …)` iterators feeding `HashMap<String, String>::from_iter`, breaking pyo3/napi/php bindings on `Metadata.additional`.
- fix(e2e/elixir): add missing commas between deps entries in generated `mix.exs`; without them Elixir emits a syntax error before deps like `{:req, ...}`.
- fix(e2e/kotlin): fall back to `alef_config.resolved_version()` when `[e2e.packages.kotlin]` has no explicit `version`, avoiding a stale `0.1.0` jar reference in `build.gradle.kts`.
- fix(e2e/gleam): strip leading underscores from generated test-function names; fixture IDs with numeric prefixes (e.g. `13_json_...`) produced `_json_..._test()` which Gleam rejects.
- fix(backend-dart): emit `lib/<pkg>.dart` barrel file re-exporting `src/<pkg>.dart` so `package:<pkg>/<pkg>.dart` imports resolve correctly in e2e tests.
- fix(e2e/elixir): normalize scientific-notation floats for Elixir syntax (`1e-10` → `1.0e-10`, strip `e+` → `e`); use `response.body` directly instead of `Jason.decode!` since Req auto-decodes JSON; fall back to `Req.request(method: :METHOD, ...)` for non-standard HTTP verbs like OPTIONS/TRACE; extract first value from Req's `[{name, [values]}]` header lists; preserve original JSON map keys instead of snake_casing them.
- fix(e2e/rust): skip `content-encoding` headers in mock server responses — server returns uncompressed bodies so forwarding a `content-encoding` header would cause clients to attempt decompression and fail; also skip setting default `content-type: application/json` when the fixture already specifies one.
- fix(extract/type_resolver): treat bare `Value` as `TypeRef::Json` to match the idiomatic `use serde_json::Value;` re-import. Without this, `HashMap<String, Value>` fields (e.g. `ProblemDetails.extensions`) sanitized to `Map<String, String>` and downstream From-impls emitted `.into_iter().collect()` between mismatched value types, breaking pyo3/napi bindings. `serde_json::Value` (full path) was already handled.

## [0.12.10] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- feat(backend-wasm/config): add `custom_rust_modules`, `exclude_fields`, and `source_crate_remaps` options for hand-written Rust modules, per-type field exclusions for `cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))`-gated source fields, and rewriting `<original_crate>::TypeName` references to `<override_crate>::TypeName` when `core_crate_override` is set.
- feat(codegen/conversions): introduce `core_type_path_remapped` / `apply_crate_remaps` so generated `From` impls reference the override crate when `source_crate_remaps` is configured, avoiding orphan-rule violations across re-export facades.

### Fixed

- fix(extract): preserve `Map<K, V>` structure during sanitization. Previously a `Map<Cow<'static, str>, serde_json::Value>` field was flattened to `TypeRef::String` whenever the key resolved through a sanitized `Named` type; the field now stays a Map so binding backends emit the correct iterator-based conversion (or `serde_wasm_bindgen::to_value` for WASM) instead of `format!("{:?}", val.<field>)`. Fixes `Metadata.additional` mismatches in pyo3, napi, php, and wasm bindings.
- fix(backend-napi): widen nested `Vec<Vec<primitive>>` element-wise in return conversion when the binding declares the wider type (`f32` → `f64`, `u64`/`usize`/`isize` → `i64`). Mirrors the existing single-Vec arm so `embed_texts` and similar functions returning `Vec<Vec<f32>>` compile.
- fix(backend-php): widen nested `Vec<Vec<u64/usize/isize>>` element-wise in return conversion to match the i64 cast emitted for single-Vec return types.
- fix(backend-php): `gen_stub_return` now respects the function's actual error variance — non-Result functions get a type-appropriate default (e.g. `String::new()`, `Vec::new()`, `None`) instead of an `Err(PhpException::default(...))` body that violates the function signature.
- fix(backend-wasm): emit `serde_wasm_bindgen::from_value` deserialization for `Vec<Vec<T>>` parameters that arrive as `JsValue`. Without it, `generate_cache_key` and similar functions taking nested-vec composites passed the raw `JsValue` into the core fn.
- fix(core/version): add `to_r_version()` converting SemVer prereleases to CRAN-compatible four-component form.
- fix(scaffold/r): generate `packages/r/src/Makevars`, `Makevars.in`, `Makevars.win.in`, and `src/entrypoint.c`.
- fix(scaffold/r): change scaffolded `Cargo.toml` crate-type from `["cdylib"]` to `["staticlib", "lib"]`.
- fix(scaffold/r): generate `packages/r/NAMESPACE` with `useDynLib` bootstrap.
- fix(scaffold/r): use `to_r_version()` in `DESCRIPTION` `Version:` field.
- fix(backend-extendr): `bridge_imports()` returns bare paths, not full `use` statements.
- fix(cli/sync-versions): write CRAN-compatible version to `packages/r/DESCRIPTION`.
- fix(cli/validate-versions): compare R DESCRIPTION against CRAN-compatible version.

## [0.12.9] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/go): add `returns_void` field to `CallConfig` so functions returning only `error` (e.g. `validate_host`, `validate_port`, `validate_language_code`) emit `err := func()` instead of `_, err := func()` in generated Go tests.
- fix(e2e/go): Go override `returns_result = true` now respected for `dedup_text` and similar functions returning `(value, error)`; previously the call-level default (`false`) overrode the per-language override.

## [0.12.8] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- fix(backend-dart): convert nested `Vec<Vec<f32>>` to `Vec<Vec<f64>>` in bridge so embed_texts return type matches binding declaration.

## [0.12.7] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- fix(backend-rustler): `force_build` honors `Application.compile_env(:rustler_precompiled, [:force_build, :<app>], false)` in addition to env var + Mix.env() heuristics, so consumers can opt into source builds via mix config.
- fix(extract): empty struct with `#[derive(Default, Serialize, Deserialize)]` is treated as a transparent NifMap data type rather than an opaque resource handle (e.g. `ExcelMetadata{}` is data, not a `ResourceArc`).
- fix(scaffold/precommit): generated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` includes the shared `kreuzberg-dev/pre-commit-hooks` repo (shfmt/shellcheck/hadolint/textlint), tracked via the new `KREUZBERG_PRECOMMIT_HOOKS_REV` template version.
- fix(e2e/java): per-fixture `options_type` overrides now collected for ObjectMapper imports/usage; previously only class-level options_type was honored, leaving overrides un-imported.
- fix(backend-magnus): optional Ruby parameters typed as `Option<magnus::Value>` (not `magnus::Value`) — handler now matches `Some(_v) if !_v.is_nil()` before calling `.funcall(...)`, fixing a compile error when an optional struct arg is omitted.
- fix(backend-pyo3): union alias types used directly in `options.py` runtime expressions (e.g. `FormatMetadata = str | ExcelMetadata | ...`) are now imported unconditionally instead of under `TYPE_CHECKING`. Because union alias RHS is evaluated at module load, all names must resolve at import time; previously the TYPE_CHECKING guard caused `NameError` for data-enum payload struct types not defined locally.
- fix(codegen/core-to-binding): `Map<String, Json>` fields now emit `.to_string()` per-value conversions (same as `Map<String, String>`). Previously the map-value branch only matched `TypeRef::String`, so `serde_json::Value` values were not converted, causing a type mismatch in NAPI-RS and other backends.
- fix(e2e/go): `go.mod` now includes `github.com/stretchr/testify` as a required dependency so generated Go test modules compile without a missing-import error.
- fix(e2e/go): `bytes`-type args now decode from base64 at runtime via `base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString`; the `encoding/base64` import is emitted only when needed.
- fix(e2e/go): optional `string` args are now passed as `*string` (address of a local) matching Go binding signatures that take pointer-to-string for nullable strings.
- fix(e2e/go): functions that return only `error` (no result value) now emit `err := fn(...)` instead of `_, err := fn(...)`, fixing a compile error when the function signature is `func(...) error`.
- fix(e2e/go): `result_is_simple` functions (returning `*string`, `*bool`, etc.) now dereference the pointer into a `value` local before assertions and emit a nil guard, rather than asserting directly on a pointer type.
- fix(e2e/go): `greater_than` assertions on optional (pointer) fields now emit a nil guard before the comparison, preventing a nil-pointer dereference.
- fix(e2e/go): `contains` assertions on optional array fields now use `strings.Join(*field_expr, " ")` instead of incorrectly dereferencing an array pointer as a string.
- fix(e2e/go): `contains_any` is now recognized as a string-assertion type that requires the `strings` import.
- fix(e2e/typescript): `package.json` local dependency now uses `file:<pkg_path>` instead of `workspace:*`, fixing resolution when the e2e package is not inside a pnpm workspace.
- fix(e2e/typescript): options-type imports now collect all distinct types across all per-fixture call overrides, not only the default call's options type; each type is imported exactly once.
- fix(e2e/typescript): `resolve_node_function_name` now converts snake_case function names to camelCase (NAPI-RS convention) when no explicit node override is set, eliminating `undefined is not a function` errors at runtime.
- fix(e2e/typescript): optional config args with no fixture value now emit `{} as unknown as <OptionsType>` instead of being skipped, matching NAPI-RS binding signatures that require the config parameter.
- fix(e2e/typescript): config `json_object` args are now cast via `as unknown as <T>` to suppress TS2352 type-overlap errors for partial config objects.
- fix(e2e/typescript): `bytes`-type args now emit `Buffer.from("<b64>", "base64")` so base64 fixture values are decoded to `Uint8Array` at test time.
- fix(e2e/typescript): `not_empty` assertions now handle array fields with `.length` checks and non-string struct fields with `!= null` presence checks, rather than emitting `.length` on every type unconditionally.
- fix(e2e/core): `CallOverride` gains an `arg_order` field to allow per-language parameter reordering when a binding's function signature differs from the canonical `args` list order.
- fix(e2e/escape): `escape_python` now escapes NUL (`\x00`) and other ASCII control characters (U+0001–U+001F) as `\xNN` sequences, preventing malformed Python string literals from non-printable fixture bytes.

## [0.12.6] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/rust): `Option<Vec<T>>` fields in `fields_array` now emit `as_deref().unwrap_or(&[])` instead of `unwrap_or("")` in the unwrap binding. Previously, `as_deref()` on `Option<Vec<T>>` yields `Option<&[T]>`, so the `&str` fallback produced an `E0308` type mismatch (e.g. `detected_languages`, `metadata.sheet_names`).
- fix(e2e/rust): `greater_than_or_equal` assertions on optional non-array fields (e.g. `Option<usize>`) now emit `.unwrap_or(0) >= N` instead of a bare `>= N` comparison. Comparing `Option<usize> >= 2` directly is a type error (e.g. `metadata.sheet_count >= 2`).
- fix(e2e/rust): `equals` assertions with string values on optional string fields that were not pre-unwrapped (e.g. inside a `result_is_vec` loop) now emit `.as_deref().unwrap_or("").trim()` instead of `.trim()` directly on `Option<String>`, fixing `E0599` no method `trim` on `Option<T>` (e.g. `metadata.output_format`).
- fix(e2e/rust): `field: "result"` used as a sentinel to refer to the whole return value no longer emits `result.result`. When the field path exactly matches the result variable name, the codegen now references the result variable directly.
- fix(e2e/c): `result_type_name` fallback now derives from the base `call.function` name instead of the C-overridden function name. When `[e2e.call.overrides.c]` sets `function = "htm_convert"` and `prefix = "htm"`, the fallback type was `HtmConvert`, which combined with the `HTM` prefix produced `HTMHtmConvert` (doubled prefix). It now correctly produces `HTMConvert`.
- fix(backend-go): `TypeRef::Bytes`-returning methods and functions no longer emit `defer C.{prefix}_free_string(ptr)`. Bytes pointers alias internal FFI storage and must not be freed by the caller; freeing via `_free_string` (which expects `*C.char`) would corrupt the parent handle and caused cgo type errors. The `unmarshalBytes` helper copies the data without freeing the source pointer.
- fix(backend-php): PHP type stub methods with non-void return types now emit `throw new \RuntimeException('Not implemented.');` instead of an empty `{ }` body. Empty bodies are invalid for non-void methods under PHPStan level 9 (`implicitlyImpureMethod` / missing return), which broke `composer check` on downstream repos (e.g. `getErrorCode(): int`, getter methods, and `*Api` static stubs).

## [0.12.5] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Per-language `core_import` derivation.** When `[wasm|dart|swift].core_crate_override` is set, the wasm backend now also routes generated Rust `use` paths and `From`/`Into` impls through the override (e.g. `spikard_core::ProblemDetails` instead of `spikard::ProblemDetails`). Without this, the override only flipped the Cargo dep key but left source paths pointing at the umbrella crate, producing E0433 unresolved-crate errors at compile time. New helper: `AlefConfig::core_import_for_language(lang)` in `crates/alef-core/src/config/mod.rs`. Defaults to `core_import()` when no override is set, so existing configs are unaffected.
- **Wasm backend respects `exclude_types` for error converters.** `gen_wasm_error_converter` calls and the WASM exports list now skip any error whose `name` is listed in `[wasm].exclude_types`, mirroring the existing exclusion behavior for structs/enums/functions. Lets a wasm-safe surface (e.g. schema validation only) drop sibling-crate errors like `GraphQLError` or `SchemaError` without the binding referencing the unlinked crate.

## [0.12.4] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- fix(backend-php): inherent-method delegation helper (`gen_php_lossy_binding_to_core_fields`) now applies per-value `.into()` and preserves the Option layer for `Map<K, Named>` and `Option<Map<K, Named>>` fields. Same bug class as 0.12.3 fix in `alef-codegen::binding_helpers`, but PHP has its own helper that needed the same patch.

## [0.12.3] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- fix(codegen/binding-helpers): `gen_lossy_binding_to_core_fields` now applies per-value `.into()` for `Map<K, Named>` and `Option<Map<K, Named>>` fields. The 0.12.2 round only patched `field_conversion_to_core` (used by the `From<Binding> for Core` impl), but the inherent-method delegation path (used for `with_chunking`, `all`, `minimal`-style wrappers on PyO3/PHP/NAPI/Magnus/Rustler) is a parallel codegen path that constructs `core_self` directly. Both paths now emit per-value `(k, v.into())` so a binding-wrapper Map value converts to the core type.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- fix(e2e/rust): `not_empty` / `is_empty` assertions on a field that is BOTH `fields_optional` AND `fields_array` now emit `as_ref().is_some_and(|v| !v.is_empty())` and `as_ref().is_none_or(|v| v.is_empty())` respectively, so `Option<Vec<T>>` struct fields (e.g. `chunks`, `images`, `pages`, `extracted_keywords`) compile against the assertion. Previously the codegen emitted `result.<field>.is_empty()` against the bare `Option<Vec<_>>`, which failed `E0599`.
- fix(e2e/rust): when a call returns `Vec<T>` (`result_is_vec` rust override), the call-site optional-string unwrap pass is skipped so per-element iteration emitted by `render_assertion` is the only place fields are accessed; previously the call-site emitted `let metadata_x = result.metadata.x.as_deref().unwrap_or("")` against `Vec<ExtractionResult>` (no `metadata` field on the Vec).
- fix(e2e/rust): non-optional `string` arguments are no longer prefixed with `&` in the call expression. The fixture binding is already a `&'static str` literal; adding another reference produced `&&str`, mismatching `&str` parameter slots (e.g. `extract_email_content(data, mime_type, ...)`). For `impl AsRef<Path>` parameters both forms still satisfy the bound thanks to `&&str: AsRef<Path>`.
- fix(e2e/rust): `not_empty` on a bare `Option<T>` result (no field) now emits `result.is_some()` when the call is annotated `result_is_option`, matching the existing `is_some()`/`is_none()` mapping for field-level checks.
- fix(backend-pyo3): python_field_type now resolves Named(DataEnum) types correctly per emit context (options.py dataclass field vs _native.pyi stub) — introduces EmitContext enum and threads it through all collection branches (Map, Vec, Optional) so that in the OptionsModule context the bare name resolves to the locally defined union type alias rather than to the native module import, eliminating the mypy type mismatch between caller-supplied `dict[str, options.ExtractionPattern]` and the annotation `dict[str, _native.ExtractionPattern]`.
- fix(codegen/core-to-binding): emit explicit arms for `Map<K, Named>`, `Option<Map<K, Named>>`, `Vec<Named>`, `Option<Vec<Named>>` instead of falling through to the binding-to-core helper (was emitting wrong-direction conversions; broke every backend that uses the shared converter for high-level `Option<Map<Named>>` fields).
- fix(backend-rustler): split native.ex `force_build:` keyword across three lines so `mix format` accepts it without reformatting (was 114 chars, exceeded Elixir's 98-char default).
- fix(codegen/binding-to-core): apply per-value `.into()` when emitting `Option<Map<K, Named>>` field conversions (was dropping the wrapper conversion, causing rustc type mismatch in PyO3/PHP/Magnus/Rustler).
- fix(codegen/binding-to-core): preserve `Option` layer in optionalized-field path when field is genuinely IR-optional (was using `unwrap_or_default` and dropping `Option`, breaking NAPI `Option<Map<K, Named>>` round-trip).

### Added

- **Per-language `core_crate_override`.** `[wasm].core_crate_override`, `[dart].core_crate_override`, and `[swift].core_crate_override` let a Rust binding crate point at a sub-crate other than `[crate.name]` (e.g. a wasm-safe `spikard-core` instead of the umbrella `spikard` facade). When set, the binding's generated `Cargo.toml` depends on `<override> = { path = "../<override>" }` (wasm) or the equivalent `crates/<override>` path (dart/swift) and the override key replaces the umbrella crate as the core dep. (`crates/alef-core/src/config/languages.rs`, `crates/alef-core/src/config/mod.rs`, `crates/alef-backend-wasm/src/gen_bindings.rs`, `crates/alef-backend-dart/src/gen_rust_crate/cargo.rs`, `crates/alef-backend-swift/src/gen_rust_crate/`)
- **Per-language `exclude_extra_dependencies`.** `[wasm|dart|swift].exclude_extra_dependencies` filters specific keys out of the merged `[crate.extra_dependencies]` set for that language only — useful when shared sibling crates (e.g. `spikard-http`, `spikard-graphql`) cannot be linked into the wasm target. (`crates/alef-core/src/config/mod.rs::extra_deps_for_language`)

Both fields default to unset/empty so existing configs produce byte-identical output.

- test(backend-wasm): round-trip test for `Map<K, Named>` field through `serde_wasm_bindgen`, locks in the contract that Named values inside a Map must have symmetric serde impls (`crates/alef-backend-wasm/tests/gen_bindings_test.rs`).

### Changed

- BREAKING(cli): `alef generate` now runs language formatters by default; pass `--no-format` to skip. The previous `--format` flag is removed (was opt-in and easily forgotten, causing generated output to fail downstream linters like `mix format`). `alef all` behaves the same way — pass `--no-format` to suppress formatters.
- refactor(codegen): introduce `TypeMapper` trait in `alef-codegen`; every backend now implements it with exhaustive `TypeRef` matching. The Go, Java, C#, and FFI backends have been migrated to `GoMapper`, `JavaMapper`/`JavaBoxedMapper`, `CsharpMapper`, and `FfiParamMapper`/`FfiReturnMapper` structs respectively — all implementing `TypeMapper`. Adding a new `TypeRef` variant now produces a compile error in every backend that hasn't handled it, retiring the silent-fallthrough bug class that previously hid `AHashMap` as `Named("AHashMap")`. The dead `extendr/type_map.rs` stub (comment-only file) has been removed; `ExtendrBackend` already implemented `TypeMapper` in `gen_bindings.rs`.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **e2e mock-server respects fixture `expected_response.headers`.** The alef-generated mock HTTP server (both the test-embedded `mock_server` module and the standalone `mock-server` binary used by cross-language e2e suites) now applies fixture-declared response headers to the served response. Previously, headers from `http.expected_response.headers` (spikard schema) and `mock_response.headers` (liter-llm schema) were silently dropped, causing consumer header assertions (CORS, request-id, auth challenge, compression, etc.) to come back as `null`. `MockResponse` gained a `headers: HashMap<String, String>` field, `Fixture::as_mock_response()` bridges headers from both schemas, and the mock-server route handlers iterate the map and apply each entry via `Response::builder().header(name, value)`. Repeated `.header()` calls preserve multi-value semantics for headers like `Set-Cookie`. (`crates/alef-e2e/src/fixture.rs`, `crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/rust.rs`)

- **go: skip method emission on opaque error types.** When a `TypeDef` is both opaque and registered as an error, `gen_go_error_struct` already emits it as a value-type struct with `Code`/`Message` fields (no `ptr`). Previously the codegen still tried to emit method bodies that dispatch through `h.ptr`, producing uncompilable Go (e.g. `GraphQLError.StatusCode` referencing `h.ptr` against a value struct). Methods on these types are now skipped. (`crates/alef-backend-go/src/gen_bindings.rs`)

### Added

- **Rust e2e call-override fields.** `[e2e.call.overrides.rust]` learns `wrap_options_in_some`, `extra_args`, `returns_result`, `result_is_vec`, and `result_is_option` to support fallible signatures whose options slot is owned `Option<T>` and which take additional trailing positional args. (`crates/alef-core/src/config/e2e.rs`, `crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/rust.rs`)

### Reverted

- **Wasm HTTP-fixture auto-skip** (introduced in fa2d03b1 then reverted in d8ff34c7). The wasm e2e target needs a real fix — a wasm-safe dispatch entrypoint that exercises HTTP fixtures in-process — rather than skipping them.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- fix(extract): recognise `AHashMap`, `IndexMap`, and `FxHashMap` as map types in the type resolver (previously fell through to `TypeRef::Named`, causing every binding backend to emit a string/opaque type instead of a real map).

### Added

- **Blocker A: HTTP fixture mock-server support for spikard-style fixtures.** The e2e generator now emits the `mock-server` binary and per-language bootstrap code for projects whose fixtures use the `http.expected_response` schema (spikard shape), not just `mock_response` (liter-llm shape). Changes:
  - `fixture.rs`: `needs_mock_server()` returns `true` for HTTP fixtures; new `as_mock_response()` bridges both schemas to a unified `MockResponse`.
  - `codegen/rust.rs`: embedded `Fixture` struct in the mock-server binary now deserializes both `mock_response` and `http.expected_response`; route-loading uses `as_mock_response()` accessor.
  - `codegen/typescript.rs`: HTTP test cases now call `fetch(MOCK_SERVER_URL/fixtures/<id>)` instead of `app.request(bare_path)`.
  - `codegen/python.rs`: conftest.py now spawns the mock-server binary and exposes `MOCK_SERVER_URL`; HTTP test functions use `urllib.request` against `/fixtures/<id>`.
  - `codegen/ruby.rs`: generates `spec/spec_helper.rb` that starts the mock-server; HTTP examples use `Net::HTTP` against `/fixtures/<id>`.
  - `codegen/php.rs`: `bootstrap.php` spawns the mock-server; HTTP tests use `MOCK_SERVER_URL` and `/fixtures/<id>`.
  - `codegen/elixir.rs`: `test_helper.exs` starts the mock-server via Port; HTTP tests use `Req` against `/fixtures/<id>`.

### Changed

- Bump templated `ext-php-rs` pin to `0.15.12` for PHP 8.5 compatibility (downstream consumers regenerate to pick up upstream's PHP 8.5 build fixes).
- **BREAKING: `[e2e.calls.X].returns_result` default flipped from `true` to `false`.** Most e2e fixture call configs target functions whose Rust signatures do not return `Result<T, E>` (e.g. `String`, `Cow<'_, str>`, `bool`, builder types). The previous default emitted `.expect("should succeed")` unconditionally, producing `no method named expect` compile errors against non-Result returns. Existing configs that genuinely call Result-returning functions (`extract_*`, `batch_extract_*`, `chunk_*`, `render_*`, `validate_*`, `detect_languages`, `blake3_hash_*`, `compute_hash`, etc.) must now set `returns_result = true` explicitly. (`crates/alef-core/src/config/e2e.rs`)

### Added

- **`alef_extract::validate_call_export(surface, module_path, function_name)` public API.** Returns `ExportValidation::Ok` when the function is exported at the declared path, `WrongPath` when the function exists but not at the given module path (includes all actual `rust_path`s found), or `NotFound` when the function is absent from the surface entirely. Used by `alef generate` to fail fast on C1 (function not re-exported at crate root) and C2 (wrong definition selected by dedup). (`crates/alef-extract/src/lib.rs`)
- **`alef_extract::return_type_fields(surface, function_name)` public API.** Returns the public fields of the struct returned by a named free function. Returns `None` for primitive, `String`, `Vec`, unit, or opaque (no-field) return types. Allows the Rust codegen to validate `result.field` assertions at generation time. (`crates/alef-extract/src/lib.rs`)
- **`[e2e.calls.X].args[].owned` flag.** When `true`, the Rust codegen emits the argument as an owned binding and passes it by value rather than by reference. Use for parameters whose Rust signature is `Vec<T>` (not `&Vec<T>` / `&[T]`) — for example `batch_extract_file(items: Vec<(PathBuf, Option<FileExtractionConfig>)>, config: &ExtractionConfig)`. Defaults to `false`. (`crates/alef-core/src/config/e2e.rs`)
- **`[e2e.calls.X].args[].element_type` field.** For `json_object` args whose Rust target is `&[T]`, set to the element type literal (`"String"`, `"f32"`, etc.) so the codegen emits `let name: Vec<element_type> = serde_json::from_value(...).unwrap();`. Without this annotation `serde_json::from_value` cannot infer the unsized slice type and the generated test fails to compile with E0277. (`crates/alef-core/src/config/e2e.rs`)

### Fixed

- **Go backend: duplicate sentinel error declarations across multiple `ErrorDef`s.** When two error enums in the same crate shared variant names (e.g. `GraphQLError::ValidationError` and `SchemaError::ValidationError`), the Go binding emitted two top-level `var (...)` blocks each declaring `ErrValidationError`, breaking compilation with `redeclared in this block`. The Go backend now emits a single consolidated sentinel block; colliding variant names are disambiguated by qualifying with the parent error's stripped base name (`ErrGraphQLValidationError` and `ErrSchemaValidationError`). Unique variant names continue to use the unqualified `Err{Variant}` form. New public APIs `alef_codegen::error_gen::gen_go_sentinel_errors` and `gen_go_error_struct` allow callers to control sentinel/struct emission independently. (`crates/alef-codegen/src/error_gen.rs`, `crates/alef-backend-go/src/gen_bindings.rs`)

- **Magnus backend: typed-options params now accept `magnus::Value`.** Functions/methods with `Option<Named>` (or `Named`) parameters previously generated a `Option<String>` ABI that forced Ruby callers to `Hash#to_json` explicitly — and any failure to do so raised `TypeError`. The binding now accepts `magnus::Value` and calls `to_json` internally before `serde_json` deserialization, so a plain Ruby Hash works directly. Closes the upstream regression in `kreuzberg-dev/html-to-markdown#334`.

- **Phase 1: Rust e2e codegen A1/A3/A4/A5 fixes** — Eliminate `E0308 expected &T found &Option<_>`, `E0308 expected Vec<T> found &_`, and `E0277 trait bound` errors via correct optional handling, owned-param passing, slice-type annotation, and simple-return-type detection.
  - **A1:** No longer wraps optional `json_object` args in `Some(...)`; desers as `T` directly, passes `&T`. (`crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/rust.rs`)
  - **A3:** Respects `owned = true`, passes by value instead of reference. (`crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/rust.rs`)
  - **A4:** Emits `Vec<element_type>` annotation for slice args when `element_type` is set. (`crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/rust.rs`)
  - **A5 (partial):** `result_is_simple = true` in call overrides redirects field-access assertions to the result variable directly. (`crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/rust.rs`)

- **Phase 2: Per-language e2e codegen fixes** — Parallel fixes across Python, TypeScript, Go, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, Elixir, and other languages to match Rust A1-A5 patterns.
  - **A1 (Python):** No longer wraps optional `json_object` args; passes values directly. When optional arg value is null, skip argument (function default handles None).
  - **A2 (Python, TypeScript, and all languages):** Respect `returns_result=false` — skip error-handling try/except/await for non-Result calls.
  - **Python codegen (`crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/python.rs`):** A1 and A2 fixes.
  - **TypeScript codegen (`crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/typescript.rs`):** A2 fix (A1 already handled correctly).

- **Phase 2: Validation hardening in `validate_fixtures_semantic()`** — Add semantic checks to catch configuration errors at `alef generate` time rather than downstream build failures.
  - **D1:** Validate call arg arity and types against IR function signatures (planned: integrate in follow-up with alef-extract).
  - **D2:** Validate return-type field paths against IR struct definitions; reject fixture assertions on fields not in the return type (planned: integrate in follow-up with alef_extract::return_type_fields).
  - **D3:** Integrate module-path validation into generate flow (D3 already implemented in alef-cli; validate.rs updated for consistency).

- **alef-cli: fixed `replace('-', "_")` Rust 2024 edition char-literal compile error.** The Rust 2024 edition requires `&str` for the first argument of `str::replace`; passing `'-'` (char) caused an E0308 in the validate-call path. (`crates/alef-cli/src/main.rs`)

## [0.11.26] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **PyO3 stubs now emit `async def` for async functions and methods so mypy accepts the `await` in the generated `api.py` wrapper.** The 0.11.24 fix changed `api.py` to use `async def fn(...): return await _rust.fn(...)` for pyo3-async functions, but the corresponding `.pyi` stub kept declaring the underlying `_rust.fn` as plain `def fn(...) -> T`. mypy then errored at every wrapper call site with `Incompatible types in "await" (actual type "T", expected type "Awaitable[Any]")`. The stub generator now reads `FunctionDef.is_async` / `MethodDef.is_async` and emits `async def` so the underlying `_rust` symbol is typed as a coroutine; the generated `api.py` wrapper's `await` then type-checks. Both free functions and instance methods (including static methods) are covered. (`crates/alef-backend-pyo3/src/gen_stubs.rs`)
- **E2E TypeScript generator now auto-produces `globalSetup.ts` for HTTP test fixtures.** The generator was only creating `globalSetup.ts` when `client_factory` was configured, leaving HTTP test suites without proper mock server setup. Tests would fail with "app is not defined" at runtime. The generator now checks `has_http_fixtures` and generates `globalSetup.ts` unconditionally when HTTP tests are present (regardless of `client_factory`). The setup creates a fetch-wrapped HTTP client (`createApp`) and exposes it as `global.app` to all test suites. Vitest's `globalSetup` config is also auto-enabled whenever `needs_global_setup` is true. (`crates/alef-e2e/src/codegen/typescript.rs`)

## [0.11.25] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **C# JSON converter switch-case block braces now match `dotnet format`'s default style.** The `gen_csharp_json_converter` writer emitted block braces aligned with the `case` keyword (col 12), but `dotnet format` reformats them one level deeper (col 16). On every commit the `csharp-format` pre-commit hook reshuffled the braces, which then broke `alef-verify`'s per-file hash check on the very next run. The generator now matches the formatter's expected output, eliminating the hook ping-pong. (`crates/alef-backend-csharp/src/gen_bindings.rs`)

## [0.11.24] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **PyO3 backend: sanitized struct fields now emit `#[serde(skip)]` to prevent JSON round-trip failures (`#44 item 1`).** Fields whose types were sanitized to `String` placeholders (e.g. `CancellationToken → String`) were included in the derived `serde::Deserialize` impl. Deserializing a binding struct from JSON would fail with "unknown field 'cancel_token'" because the core type never expects that field. The fix adds `serde(skip)` alongside the existing opaque-field skip logic, so sanitized fields are excluded from JSON serialization/deserialization. (`crates/alef-codegen/src/generators/structs.rs`)
- **PyO3 backend: sanitized enum-like fields no longer cause "unknown variant ''" round-trip errors (`#44 item 2`).** A non-`Option` enum field sanitized to `String` (e.g. `result_format: OutputFormat → String`) derived `Default` as `String::default()` → `""`. Round-tripping through serde then failed with "unknown variant ''". The same `serde(skip)` fix from item 1 applies: the field is excluded from JSON, so the in-memory default is used silently. (`crates/alef-codegen/src/generators/structs.rs`)
- **`api.py` wrappers now forward arguments by keyword to match pyo3 signature order (`#44 item 3`).** The Python wrapper called `_rust.fn(path, config, mime_type)` in wrapper-declaration order, which misaligned with the pyo3 `#[pyo3(signature = (path, mime_type=None, config=None))]` declaration. The call is now `_rust.fn(path=path, mime_type=mime_type, config=config)` so slot alignment is independent of order. (`crates/alef-backend-pyo3/src/gen_bindings.rs`)
- **Async pyo3 functions now produce `async def` + `await` wrappers in `api.py` (`#44 item 4`).** Functions with `is_async = true` were emitted as plain `def fn(...)` wrappers that returned a coroutine directly. Callers who assigned the result without awaiting got a coroutine object instead of the resolved value, and type checkers saw the wrong return type. The generated wrapper is now `async def fn(...): ... return await _rust.fn(...)`. (`crates/alef-backend-pyo3/src/gen_bindings.rs`)
- **Trait-bridge `register_*` helpers are now exported via `api.py` and included in `__init__.py` `__all__` (`#44 item 5`).** `register_embedding_backend` and `register_ocr_backend` were added as `#[pyfunction]` to the pyo3 module but were absent from `api.py` and `__all__`, so `kreuzberg.register_ocr_backend(...)` raised `ImportError`. Pass-through wrappers are now emitted in `api.py` for all trait bridges that declare `register_fn`, and both `__init__.py` imports and `__all__` are updated accordingly. (`crates/alef-backend-pyo3/src/gen_bindings.rs`)

### Changed

- **PyO3 and NAPI generated bindings suppress pedantic/nursery clippy lints that don't apply to autogenerated FFI code.** Downstream projects that opt into `clippy::pedantic = "deny"` and `clippy::nursery = "deny"` (e.g. spikard's `[workspace.lints.clippy]`) were getting 240+ errors in `crates/<crate>-py/src/lib.rs` and `crates/<crate>-node/src/lib.rs` — none of them real bugs, all of them stylistic complaints about generated wrappers (every accessor wanting `#[must_use]`, every `-> CrateName` wanting `-> Self`, every `as` cast at the JS/Python boundary, every `Deserialize` derive on a type that has unsafe FFI methods). Fixing each in the generators would require per-template rewrites with no functional impact, so both backends now emit a documented `#![allow(clippy::*)]` block covering the FFI-specific false-positives: `unsafe_derive_deserialize`, `must_use_candidate`, `return_self_not_must_use`, `use_self`, `missing_const_for_fn`, `missing_errors_doc`, `needless_pass_by_value`, `doc_markdown`, `derive_partial_eq_without_eq`, `uninlined_format_args`, `redundant_clone`, `implicit_clone`, `redundant_closure_for_method_calls`, `wildcard_imports`, `option_if_let_else`, `too_many_lines`. NAPI also picks up the cast-family lints (`cast_possible_wrap`, `cast_possible_truncation`, `cast_sign_loss`) that pyo3 already had. Each entry is annotated with the rationale in the source. (`crates/alef-backend-pyo3/src/gen_bindings.rs`, `crates/alef-backend-napi/src/gen_bindings.rs`)

## [0.11.23] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **C# csproj `<None Include="../../../LICENSE" />` had three `../` segments; flat csproj layout (`packages/csharp/<Namespace>.csproj`) only needs two to reach the repo root.** With three `../` segments, `dotnet pack` resolved the LICENSE path to one directory *above* the repo and bailed with `error NU5019: File not found`. The csproj is scaffold-once so existing repos keep their hand-fixed value, but new scaffolds now emit `../../LICENSE`. (`crates/alef-scaffold/src/languages/csharp.rs`)

## [0.11.22] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **Rustler NIF emission for `&self` opaque methods no longer requires `T: Clone`.** The 0.11.21 fix replaced `resource.inner.as_ref().clone().method(...)` with `(*resource.inner).clone().method(...)` to silence `noop_method_call`, but that pattern requires the underlying opaque type to implement `Clone` — and many real opaque types (e.g. tree-sitter-language-pack's `DownloadManager`) intentionally don't, since they wrap non-cloneable resources like dynamic-library handles. Compilation failed with `error[E0599]: no method named clone found for struct DownloadManager` across every emitted opaque-method call. The emit is now `ReceiverKind`-aware: `ReceiverKind::Ref` produces `resource.inner.method(...)` (Arc<T> derefs to &T, no clone needed); `ReceiverKind::RefMut` and `ReceiverKind::Owned` keep `(*resource.inner).clone().method(...)` (still requires `T: Clone`, but those receiver kinds are uncommon for opaque types and callers can use `[<lang>] exclude_functions` if the type isn't cloneable). Same fix applied to the sync (`gen_nif_method`) and async (`gen_nif_async_method`) call paths.

## [0.11.21] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **Rustler NIF instance-method calls no longer trip `noop_method_call` under `clippy -D warnings`.** `gen_bindings/functions.rs` emitted `resource.inner.as_ref().clone().method(...)` for opaque instance methods. `Arc::as_ref()` returns `&T`; `.clone()` then resolves to `<&T as Clone>::clone` (a pointless reference-clone returning another `&T`), and the lint flagged every emitted NIF call site under `-D warnings`. tree-sitter-language-pack's Elixir NIF builds failed across all 3 platforms (linux-x86_64, linux-aarch64, macos-arm64) with dozens of `error: call to .clone() on a reference in this situation does nothing` at every generated method. The emission now uses `(*resource.inner).clone().method(...)` — the `*` dereferences `Arc<T>` to `T`, so `.clone()` resolves to `<T as Clone>::clone` and produces an owned `T` the method can consume. Same fix applied to both the sync (`gen_nif_method`) and async (`gen_nif_async_method`) emission paths.

## [0.11.20] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **`alef sync-versions` no longer skips work based on a stale `.alef/last_synced_version` cache.** The previous warm-path short-circuit returned early whenever the cached version matched `Cargo.toml`'s, on the assumption that "same version → all manifests still in sync." That assumption breaks in three real cases: a manifest hand-edited to the wrong version, a *new* manifest added after the last sync (e.g. `e2e/rust/Cargo.toml` introduced by `alef e2e generate`), or a stale `alef:hash:` line whose content drifted. CI runs without the cache and re-derives the correct state, so the local hook stayed silent while the `alef-sync-versions` pre-commit hook failed in CI for downstream consumers (most recently: liter-llm rc.14, kreuzcrawl, html-to-markdown, tree-sitter-language-pack — all required `rm -rf .alef` to reproduce the diff). The function now always walks every manifest. The scan is sub-second on kreuzberg-sized repos and the underlying writes are idempotent when nothing is actually stale, so the cost is invisible. The `.alef/last_synced_version` stamp is still written for forward-compatible introspection but is no longer consulted as a gate. (`crates/alef-cli/src/pipeline/version.rs`)

### Added

- **`[csharp].package_id` config field for NuGet `<PackageId>`, decoupled from `[csharp].namespace`.** The csharp scaffold previously emitted both `<RootNamespace>` and `<PackageId>` from `csharp_namespace()`, conflating two distinct identifiers. That conflation silently broke html-to-markdown's NuGet publish: the consumer-facing namespace `HtmlToMarkdown` is owned on nuget.org by an unrelated third party (Enrico Rossini), but the historical `KreuzbergDev.HtmlToMarkdown` package was owned by us. The alef migration overwrote the published-artifact id, and every release returned `403 (does not have permission to access the specified package)` until the csproj was hand-edited. Setting `[csharp] package_id = "KreuzbergDev.HtmlToMarkdown"` now lets the project publish to the owned coordinate while the in-code namespace stays the short, idiomatic form. When unset, `package_id` defaults to `namespace` — existing configs keep their behaviour. New accessor: `AlefConfig::csharp_package_id()`.

### Changed

- **PHP composer name and Swift Package URL no longer hardcode `kreuzberg`.** The PHP e2e composer.json `"name"` field now derives `<vendor>/e2e-php` from the consumer-binding pkg vendor, and the PSR-4 autoload namespace uses the configured PHP namespace (`<configured>\E2e\\`). The PHP README's `composer require <vendor>/<crate>` line uses the same derivation. The PHP e2e `pkg_name` fallback for `[e2e.packages.php].name` derives `<org>/<module>` from `[scaffold] repository` (instead of `kreuzberg/<module>`). The Swift e2e `Package.swift` `.package(url: ...)` for registry mode now uses the configured repository URL with a `.git` suffix, falling back to a vendor-neutral `https://example.invalid/<module>.git` placeholder. New `derive_repo_org()` helper exposed in `alef_core::config`.
- **`alef init` no longer writes `dev.kreuzberg` / `kreuzberg-dev` literals into freshly generated `alef.toml`.** When invoked in a project whose `Cargo.toml` declares `[package] repository = "..."`, the generated config now seeds `[scaffold] repository`, derives `[go] module` from it, and derives `[java] package` via the same reverse-DNS rule as `AlefConfig::java_package()` — so `repository = "https://github.com/foo-org/bar"` produces `module = "github.com/foo-org/bar"` and `package = "com.github.foo_org"`. When the repository is unset, the affected sections are emitted with the offending fields commented out and a `# TODO: set this` marker, instead of writing a plausible-looking but wrong default. When `[go].module` is unset, alef now derives the module path from `[scaffold] repository` / `[e2e.registry] github_repo` by stripping the `https://` scheme (`https://github.com/foo/bar` → `github.com/foo/bar`). When no repository is configured at all, the fallback is a vendor-neutral `example.invalid/<crate>` placeholder that fails `go build` loudly. The internal `package_name()` helper's last-resort `unwrap_or("kreuzberg")` is now `"binding"` (this branch is unreachable in practice — `next_back()` on a non-empty `split('/')` always returns `Some` — but the literal is gone). New `try_go_module()` accessor returns `Result<String, String>` for callers that should error rather than emit the placeholder.
- **Java/Kotlin package fallback no longer hardcodes `dev.kreuzberg`.** When `[java].package` / `[kotlin].package` is unset, alef now derives a reverse-DNS package from the configured repository URL (`[scaffold] repository` or `[e2e.registry] github_repo`): `https://<host>/<org>/<rest>` becomes `<reversed-host>.<org>` (host labels reversed, hyphens replaced with underscores). For kreuzberg-dev consumers (`https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/<crate>`) this produces `com.github.kreuzberg_dev` — *different* from the previous `dev.kreuzberg` literal. **Action required:** kreuzberg-dev consumers should set `[java] package = "dev.kreuzberg"` and `[kotlin] package = "dev.kreuzberg"` in their `alef.toml` to keep the existing namespace. When no repository URL is configured at all, `java_package()` / `kotlin_package()` fall back to `unconfigured.alef` so the build fails loudly. New `try_java_package()` / `try_kotlin_package()` accessors return `Result<String, String>` for callers that should error rather than emit the placeholder.
- **README scaffolding no longer falls back to `https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/<crate>` when no repository is configured.** Alef is meant to be vendor-neutral; consumers outside the kreuzberg-dev org were silently picking up that URL in 13 places across `alef-readme` (the README header link plus 12 per-language "See <repo> for usage examples." pointers). The 13 inline `format!("https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/{name}")` calls now route through a single `AlefConfig::github_repo()` accessor whose fallback is `https://example.invalid/<crate>` — an obviously-broken URL that surfaces in code review instead of smuggling another organization's link into the output. Set `[scaffold] repository = "..."` (or `[e2e.registry] github_repo`) in your `alef.toml` to resolve. A new `AlefConfig::try_github_repo() -> Result<String, String>` accessor is available for callers that should fail hard on missing config.

### Fixed

- **C# wrapper class methods now thread `IntPtr handle` for non-static methods.** `gen_pinvoke_for_method` and `gen_wrapper_method` previously only emitted the visible parameter list, ignoring the receiver. The cbindgen-emitted FFI signature for an instance method is `fn(this: *const T, ...)`, so the C# P/Invoke and the wrapper call site were one argument short — `dotnet build` failed with `CS7036: There is no argument given that corresponds to the required parameter 'ptr'`. Both functions now detect `!method.is_static && method.receiver.is_some()` and prepend `IntPtr handle` (P/Invoke signature) / `handle` (wrapper-to-native call argument) so the surfaces line up.
- **Kotlin error typealiases now use the `Exception` suffix to avoid colliding with same-named structs.** When an `errors` variant shares a name with a struct in `api.types` (e.g. an error variant `Foo` and a struct `Foo`), the previous `typealias Foo = pkg.FooException` would clash with the struct's own `typealias Foo = pkg.Foo`, and `compileKotlin` failed with `Redeclaration:`. The error alias now uses `typealias FooException = pkg.FooException`, mirroring the Java facade's class name; struct typealiases are unchanged.
- **Kotlin scaffold sample object renamed to plain `Sample` so its filename is not project-specific.** ktlint's `filename` rule requires a file with a single top-level declaration to match the declaration name. The sample object is now named `Sample` (matching `Sample.kt`) instead of `<ProjectName>Sample` (which would require `<ProjectName>Sample.kt`); the project name still appears in the body's `println` for context.
- **Gleam scaffold emits a valid `manifest.toml`.** Previous output was a comment-only stub, which gleam's TOML parser rejects with `missing field 'requirements'` on every `gleam check` / `gleam build` invocation. The scaffolded manifest now contains the minimum gleam expects (`packages = []` plus an empty `[requirements]` table); `gleam build` repopulates it on the first run.
- **Java scaffold's checkstyle config now resolves `${checkstyle.suppressions.file}`.** The pom.xml `<configuration>` block references a checkstyle config that requires the `checkstyle.suppressions.file` property to be set, but the config never told maven-checkstyle-plugin where to load that property from. Adds `<propertiesLocation>${project.basedir}/checkstyle.properties</propertiesLocation>` to the plugin config. Also fixes the property's value in `checkstyle.properties` to be relative to packages/java/ (the maven cwd) rather than to repo root.

## [0.11.19] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **`sync-versions` now updates `packages/ruby/Gemfile.lock` alongside the gemspec.** After a version bump the gemspec received the new version but the lockfile was not touched, causing `bundle install` to abort with "The gemspecs for path gems changed, but the lockfile can't be updated because frozen mode is set" on every CI run. `sync_versions` now textually replaces all `<gem-name> (<old-version>)` entries for path gems in Gemfile.lock (both the `PATH > specs` block and the `CHECKSUMS` block) with the new RubyGems-format version. The replacement is idempotent — a second sync with the same version is a no-op.
- **`has_derive` now recognises namespaced derive paths** like `#[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]`. The bare-ident form (`#[derive(Serialize)]`) was already detected, but the namespaced form fell through and IR types ended up with `has_serde: false`. Backends that gate `_to_json` / `_from_json` emission on `has_serde` (which is correct) then produced binding code referencing FFI functions that don't exist (e.g. `C.spikard_sse_event_to_json` for spikard's `SseEvent`, which derives `serde::Serialize`). The cfg_attr branch already used last-segment matching; the direct-derive branch now mirrors that.
- **Go backend C type references now preserve all-caps abbreviations.** Mirror of the FFI cbindgen-forward-decl fix: `alef-backend-go` ran type names through `heck::ToPascalCase` in seven places (free-method receiver, opaque-handle marshalling, return-value unwrapping, trait bridge trampolines, the `type_name` helper used in unmarshalFoo function names). For types like `GraphQLError` this produced `C.SPIKARDGraphQlError` in the generated `binding.go`, which doesn't match cbindgen's actual `SPIKARDGraphQLError` and causes `go build` to fail with "could not determine what C.SPIKARDGraphQlError refers to". IR type names are already PascalCase from Rust source — the conversion was both unnecessary and harmful for acronym-bearing types. Field-name renaming (`field_name.to_pascal_case()` for `serde_rename_all = "PascalCase"`) and method-name conversion are unchanged.
- **FFI cbindgen forward declarations now match cbindgen's actual emit for types with all-caps abbreviations.** The forward-declaration block in the generated `cbindgen.toml` ran type names through `heck::ToPascalCase`, which mangles abbreviations: `GraphQLError` becomes `GraphQlError`, but cbindgen emits the actual struct in the C header as `SPIKARDGraphQLError` (literal Rust name + prefix). Consumers compiling against the header saw two different type names for the same struct and the build failed (`unknown type name 'SPIKARDGraphQLRouteConfig'; did you mean 'SPIKARDGraphQlRouteConfig'?`). The pre-declarations now use the IR type name verbatim.
- **Java/Kotlin e2e codegen now respects `[java].package` and `[kotlin].package`.** Previously the e2e generators hardcoded `dev.kreuzberg` in three places: the pom.xml `<groupId>`, the test-file `package` declarations, and the generated filesystem path (`src/test/{java,kotlin}/dev/kreuzberg/e2e/...`). Projects whose Java/Kotlin package config used a different group id (e.g. spikard's `dev.spikard`) ended up with package declarations that disagreed with their filesystem location, breaking compilation. The generators now use `alef_config.java_group_id()` / `alef_config.kotlin_package()` consistently — pom.xml `<groupId>`, gradle `group =`, the `package` line, and the path segments all derive from the configured value.

## [0.11.18] - 2026-04-29

A patch release that fixes Javadoc emission so HTML inside backticks survives the Eclipse-formatter Spotless pipeline.

### Fixed

- **Javadoc `{@code …}` content now HTML-escapes its inner `<`, `>`, `&` characters.** A Rust doc comment like `` /// Determines how code blocks (`<pre><code>`) are rendered `` previously emitted `{@code <pre><code>}` with raw HTML inside the tag. Eclipse-formatter Spotless (used by html-to-markdown's `packages/java/pom.xml`) interprets the inner `<pre>` as a real block-level HTML element and shatters the doc comment across multiple `* ` rows — which then breaks `alef-verify` on the very next prek run. The codegen now emits `{@code &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;}` so Spotless leaves the line alone; readers see the same text since Javadoc renders `{@code}` literally regardless. Both `alef-codegen::doc_emission::escape_javadoc_line` and `alef-backend-java::gen_bindings::helpers::escape_javadoc_line` carry the fix.

### Fixed

- **Python e2e codegen no longer triggers ruff `F401` on `import pytest`.**

## [0.11.17] - 2026-04-29

PHP backend: fix flat-enum codegen to emit correct code instead of no-op conversions.

### Fixed

- **PHP flat-enum `From` impls no longer emit no-op `.into()` for primitive and `String` fields.** `flat_enum_core_to_binding_field_expr` and `flat_enum_binding_to_core_field_expr` previously fell through to `.map(Into::into)` / `.into()` for all types not explicitly handled. For primitives (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `i32`, `bool`, `f32`, `f64`, etc.) and `String`, the PHP binding type equals the core type, so `Into::into` is a no-op and triggered `clippy::useless_conversion`. Both functions now emit direct assignment for these same-type cases.
- **PHP flat-enum getter methods no longer call `.clone()` on `Copy` types.** Getters for `Option<u32>`, `Option<u8>`, `Option<bool>`, `Option<i64>` etc. previously always emitted `self.field.clone()`, which triggered `clippy::clone_on_copy`. Getters for Copy fields (`is_php_copy_type` helper: `Primitive` and `Option<Primitive>`) now emit `self.field` directly.
- **PHP flat-enum `From` impls no longer emit `..Default::default()` when all struct fields are covered.** When a variant's explicit field assignments already cover every field in the flat struct, the trailing `..Default::default()` is redundant and triggered `clippy::needless_update`. The codegen now pre-computes the complete set of flat field names and omits the struct update when the variant sets all of them. When `e2e.call.async = true` (or any test in the file is async/skipped/has error assertions), the python e2e generator emits `import pytest` at module level. Pytest is needed for `pytest.fixture` / `pytest.mark.*` decorators, but ruff's `F401` rule strips the import when no symbol is statically referenced in the file body — which then causes `alef verify` to fail on subsequent runs because the file's hash no longer matches the generated content. The import is now suppressed with `# noqa: F401`.

## [0.11.16] - 2026-04-29

WASM trait bridges and FFI multi-crate codegen fixes.

### Added

- **`[wasm.extra_dependencies]` table in `alef.toml`.** Mirrors `[crate.extra_dependencies]` but applies only to the WASM binding `Cargo.toml`. Initial use case: `async-trait = "0.1"` so generated wasm bridges can use `#[async_trait::async_trait(?Send)]` without callers having to declare it manually.

### Fixed

- **WASM trait bridge async impls now correctly emit `#[async_trait::async_trait(?Send)]`.** `gen_bridge_trait_impl` in `alef-codegen` always emitted `#[async_trait::async_trait]` (the default `+ Send` variant), which produced `error[E0053]: method ... has an incompatible type for trait` on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`: the underlying trait future was not `Send`-bounded but the macro-rewritten impl signature was. Added `async_trait_is_send() -> bool` (default: `true`) on the `TraitBridgeGenerator` trait; the wasm backend overrides it to `false`, and `gen_bridge_trait_impl` selects between `#[async_trait::async_trait]` and `#[async_trait::async_trait(?Send)]` accordingly. WASM bindings (kreuzberg-wasm and any other wasm-target generator) now compile clean for `OcrBackend`, `PostProcessor`, `Validator`, and `EmbeddingBackend` bridges.
- **FFI scaffold now merges `[crate.extra_dependencies]` into the generated `crates/<crate>-ffi/Cargo.toml`.** Previously the scaffold emitted only the umbrella crate (e.g. `kreuzberg = { path = "../kreuzberg" }`) plus `serde_json` and `tokio`, which worked when the public API surface lived in a single workspace crate. For multi-crate workspaces (e.g. spikard's `spikard-core`, `spikard-http`, `spikard-graphql`), the FFI bindings codegen emits qualified paths like `spikard_http::ServerConfig` and `spikard_graphql::QueryOnlyConfig` — the cdylib failed to compile because those crates were not direct dependencies. The scaffold now merges entries from `[crate.extra_dependencies]` (sorted, alphabetised) into the `[dependencies]` block, matching the behaviour of the wasm backend.
- **FFI codegen no longer double-prefixes sibling-crate paths in field accessors.** The path-qualification logic in `gen_field_accessor` previously only treated `module_prefix` as already-qualified when it equalled `core_import` or started with `core_import::`. For sibling workspace crates whose names share the project's prefix (e.g. `core_import = "spikard"`, sibling crate `spikard_http`), `module_prefix.starts_with("spikard::")` was false and the codegen emitted `spikard::spikard_http::openapi::OpenApiConfig` — a path that doesn't exist. The check now also accepts `{core_import}_` as a sibling-crate marker, so sibling-crate paths render verbatim.
- **FFI field accessors now look up Named types in the per-binding `path_map`.** When a struct field's `type_rust_path` is `None` in the IR (which alef emits when the type is referenced by short name), the field accessor previously fell back to `core_import` and produced paths like `spikard::ContactInfo` — which fails when the type lives in a sibling crate (`spikard_http::ContactInfo`) and is not re-exported through the umbrella crate. `gen_field_accessor` now threads the `path_map` built in `gen_bindings::generate` and uses `c_return_type_with_paths`, matching the behaviour of `gen_method_wrapper` and `gen_free_function`.
- **FFI codegen now uses `.map(str::to_owned)` for `Option<&str>` returns.** Methods returning `Option<&str>` (e.g. a `get_description() -> Option<&str>` accessor) previously emitted `let result = result.cloned();`, which fails to compile because `str: !Sized` and `Option::cloned` requires `T: Clone` on a sized type. The codegen now special-cases `TypeRef::Optional(TypeRef::String)` to emit `.map(str::to_owned)` instead. The existing `.cloned()` path still applies to `Option<&NamedType>`, `Option<&Vec<...>>`, and `Option<&char>`.
- **FFI codegen now uses `.to_owned()` for `&str` returns (was `.clone()`, a no-op).** Methods returning `&str` previously emitted `let result = result.clone();` — which compiles but is a no-op (str: !Sized doesn't impl Clone, so the call is a noop on the reference) and triggers Rust's `noop_method_call` lint. The codegen now emits `.to_owned()`, producing the owned `String` the FFI layer needs.
- **FFI no longer emits duplicate `to_json` / `from_json` exports when the type defines those methods.** Types that derive both `serde::Serialize` and a manual `to_json` / `from_json` method (e.g. `ProblemDetails::to_json`) caused two FFI functions with the same C name (`{prefix}_{type}_to_json`) — one from the auto-serde codegen path and one from `gen_method_wrapper` — and the cdylib failed with `E0428: defined multiple times`. The auto-serde codegen now skips emitting `to_json` / `from_json` when the type already defines a method of that name.

## [0.11.15] - 2026-04-29

PHP backend: fix codegen errors in tagged data enum `From` impls.

### Fixed

- **PHP flat data enum `From` impls now handle all field kinds correctly.** `gen_flat_data_enum_from_impls` previously emitted `.into()` unconditionally for every variant field, which compiled only when `From<BindingType>` happened to exist. Four cases were missing:
  - **`sanitized: true` fields** (e.g. `TableGrid`, `ImageMetadata`, `PdfMetadata`, `ProcessResult`, `[(u32,u32);4]`): now emits `None` / `Default::default()` instead of trying to convert an opaque or complex core type through a String.
  - **`is_boxed: true` fields** (e.g. `FormatMetadata::Docx(Box<DocxMetadata>)`, `::Html(Box<HtmlMetadata>)`): now wraps the core→binding result in `Some((*val).into())` and the binding→core result in `Box::new(...)`.
  - **`TypeRef::Path` fields** (e.g. `ChunkSizing::Tokenizer { cache_dir: Option<PathBuf> }`): now uses `PathBuf::from(s)` for binding→core and `.to_string_lossy().into_owned()` for core→binding instead of `.into()` (no `From<PathBuf> for String` exists).
  - **`TypeRef::Primitive(Usize | U64 | Isize)` fields** (e.g. `EmbeddingModelType::Custom { dimensions: usize }`): now emits `v as usize` / `v as i64` explicit casts instead of `.into()` (no `From<i64> for usize` exists).
  - Struct variant destructuring patterns for sanitized fields now use `field: _field` syntax (not `_field` alone) to satisfy the Rust struct-pattern completeness requirement.

## [0.11.14] - 2026-04-29

CLI ergonomics, generation performance, and live output for long-running commands. Warm `alef generate` on a 16-language consumer (kreuzberg) drops from ~14s to ~1s.

### Added

- **Standard CLI affordances.** `alef --version` (and `-V`) prints the binary version. New global flags `--verbose` / `-v` (repeatable: `-v` info, `-vv` debug, `-vvv` trace), `--quiet` / `-q` (errors only), and `--no-color` (disable ANSI in log output). Tracing now defaults to `info`-level output on stderr — previously the CLI was effectively silent unless `RUST_LOG` was set, which meant users had no signal during long-running commands.
- **Live streamed output for long-running commands.** `alef setup`, `alef update`, `alef update --latest`, `alef lint`, `alef fmt`, `alef test`, and `alef clean` now stream stdout/stderr to the terminal in real time, line-prefixed with `[<lang>]` when multiple languages run in parallel. Previously output was captured and only re-emitted via `tracing::info!` after the command finished — producing a multi-minute blackout for `pnpm install` / `bundle install` / `cargo update`. Failures are now also surfaced via an explicit `✗ <command> failed: <lang> — <error>` summary line on stderr.

### Changed

- **`alef generate` no longer runs formatters by default.** Formatting was the dominant cost of `alef generate` on multi-language projects (e.g. `cargo fmt --all`, `ruff check --fix .`, `biome format --write .`, `dotnet format`) and ran on the full package directory every invocation — even when only one language regenerated. The behaviour is now opt-in: pass `--format` to `alef generate`, `alef all`, or `alef init` to run formatters. When `--format` is passed, formatters run *only* for languages that actually regenerated this run (other languages skip), making warm `alef generate --format` proportional to changed source files. The tradeoff: projects that previously relied on the implicit format pass to keep `alef verify` green should either (a) pass `--format`, (b) keep formatters in pre-commit hooks, or (c) run `alef fmt` explicitly after generate.

### Performance

- **Public API codegen is now cached.** `pipeline::generate_public_api` output is hashed and skip-written like binding files; previously every warm run rewrote 200+ Python `api.py` / `options.py` / `__init__.py` files for no net change.
- **Deterministic Python public-API imports.** The PyO3 backend's `gen_api_py` collected import names into an `AHashSet` then emitted them via `.join(", ")` — `AHashSet` iteration order is non-deterministic, so the codegen output flipped between runs and the content-hash cache always missed. Imports are now sorted before emit.
- **Idempotent `sync_versions`.** `replace_version_pattern` previously returned `Some(new_content)` whenever its regex matched, even when the rewrite was byte-identical (e.g. when Magnus emits `VERSION = "x"` with double-quotes and the replacement template uses single-quotes). Each `alef generate` then ping-pong-rewrote `version.rb`, marked it as drifted, and triggered a full README regeneration. The function now extracts the version literal from the match and short-circuits when it already equals the target — quote style irrelevant.
- **`sync_versions` short-circuits on warm runs.** Stamps `.alef/last_synced_version` after each successful sync; the next warm run with no `--bump` and an unchanged canonical version skips the entire glob+regex+stat pass over package manifests. When a sync does run, only `readme/docs/scaffold` stage caches are invalidated; the IR cache and per-language binding hashes are preserved.
- **`sources_hash` mtime-prefilter.** A per-source `(mtime_nanos, size)` memo at `.alef/sources_hash.cache` lets warm runs return the previous aggregate hash directly when nothing in the source tree has changed — skipping the read+blake3 pass over every `[crate].sources` file.
- **Hot extractor optimisations.** `extract_serde_rename_all` parses with `attr.parse_nested_meta` instead of stringifying the entire token stream and substring-scanning. `normalize_type_string` now scans bytes directly instead of materialising a `Vec<char>` per call. Combined, these halve allocations on the cold extraction path for large API surfaces.
- **Single-pass `to_pep440`.** Rewritten to build the output in one pre-allocated `String` instead of chaining five `.replace()` calls, each of which allocates a fresh intermediate.
- **`extract_version` regex cache.** The verify path's `extract_version` helper now caches compiled regexes in `OnceLock<Mutex<HashMap>>` so the ~15 verify patterns aren't recompiled per file.
- **Gleam variant collision map** uses `ahash::AHashMap` with `&str` keys; only colliding names allocate owned `String`s (was: `HashMap<String, _>` with per-variant clone).

## [0.11.13] - 2026-04-29

A patch release that addresses two regressions surfaced by the tree-sitter-language-pack v1.8.0-rc.14 release: copy-paste duplication in generated Java FFI methods and Spotless/`alef-verify` hash drift.

### Fixed

- **Java backend deduplicates the FFI Vec-return path through a shared `readJsonList` helper.** Every Vec-returning method previously inlined an identical ~15-line null-check → reinterpret → free → JSON deserialize block, which `cpd` correctly flagged as duplication. The boilerplate now lives in a single private static helper emitted by the helper-emitter; per-method call sites collapse to one line.
- **Java auto-format prefers Spotless when `packages/java/pom.xml` configures `spotless-maven-plugin`.** When detected, `alef generate` runs `mvn -f packages/java/pom.xml spotless:apply -q` instead of `google-java-format`, so the embedded `alef:hash:` value matches what the project's `mvn spotless:check` will see at verification time. Previously the hash drifted on every `alef generate` → prek cycle for any project whose Spotless config diverges from google-java-format defaults (e.g., Eclipse formatter).

## [0.11.12] - 2026-04-29

A patch release that fixes the Java backend so functions returning `PathBuf` emit a properly-typed `java.nio.file.Path` value instead of a raw `String`.

### Fixed

- **Java backend now wraps FFI string returns with `java.nio.file.Path.of(str)` when the declared return type is `Path`.** Previously, methods like `cacheDir()` were declared to return `java.nio.file.Path` but the body returned the raw `String` result of the FFI call, causing `javac` to reject the generated code with "incompatible types". Both `Path` and `Optional<Path>` are now handled correctly.

## [0.11.11] - 2026-04-29

A patch release that adds a `returns_result: bool` field to e2e `[CallConfig]` so the Rust generator can skip the `.expect("should succeed")` unwrap for native non-Result-returning calls.

### Added

- **`[e2e.calls.<name>] returns_result = false`** lets fixture authors mark a call whose Rust function signature returns `T` directly (e.g. `String`, `Vec<u8>`, `bool`, a hash) rather than `Result<T, _>`. The Rust code generator now binds the value with no unwrap when this is set; previous behavior always emitted `.expect("should succeed")`, which failed to compile against any non-Result function. Defaults to `true` to preserve existing behavior.

## [0.11.10] - 2026-04-29

A patch release that fixes the NAPI/Node backend so functions whose only sanitized parameter is a configured `[[trait_bridges]]` param (e.g. `Option<VisitorHandle>`) are emitted via the bridge instead of being silently skipped.

### Fixed

- **NAPI backend now emits top-level functions that take a configured trait-bridge parameter, even when the function is marked sanitized.** Previously the sanitized check ran before `find_bridge_param`, so html-to-markdown's top-level `convert(html, options, Option<VisitorHandle>)` was dropped from the Node binding, causing downstream `import { convert }` to fail at TypeScript compile time. The check now skips a function only when it's sanitized AND no trait-bridge param applies — matching how the PyO3 backend already handles this case (which is why Python had `convert` and Node didn't).

## [0.11.9] - 2026-04-29

A patch release that fixes the PHP backend's lowering of tagged enums with **tuple variants** holding distinct types.

### Fixed

- **PHP backend now gives each tuple variant of a tagged enum its own distinct field instead of collapsing them all to a shared `_0` field.** Previously `pub enum Message { System(SystemMessage), User(UserMessage), … }` lowered to a single `_0: Option<SystemMessage>` (the first variant's type) and the From impls then tried to assign `UserMessage`/`AssistantMessage`/etc to that one field, producing N trait-bound errors per non-first variant. Single-field tuple variants now use the variant's snake_case name as the field name (`system: Option<SystemMessage>`, `user: Option<UserMessage>`, …); multi-field tuple variants get `{variant}_0`, `{variant}_1`, …. Struct variants are unchanged.

## [0.11.8] - 2026-04-29

A patch release that fixes the PHP and Rustler/Elixir backends to preserve struct-variant fields when lowering tagged enums, plus two smaller release-pipeline fixes.

### Fixed

- **PHP backend now generates a real wrapper class for tagged enums with struct variants instead of emitting only string constants.** Previously `pub enum SecuritySchemeInfo { Http { scheme, bearer_format }, ApiKey { location, name } }` was lowered to a few `pub const` strings, the surrounding struct field was demoted to `HashMap<String, String>`, and the generated `From<core::Outer> for php::Outer` impl emitted `(k, v.into())` against the original enum value — which fails to compile with `the trait bound \`String: From<SecuritySchemeInfo>\` is not satisfied`. The backend now emits a flat php_class with a`type_tag` discriminator plus optional fields for every variant, full `#[php_impl]` getters, a `from_json` constructor, and proper `From` impls in both directions. Fixes spikard-php builds with `--features extension-module`.
- **Rustler/Elixir backend now preserves struct-variant fields in tagged enums instead of silently dropping them.** Previously every enum was lowered to `rustler::NifUnitEnum`, so `SecuritySchemeInfo::Http { scheme, bearer_format }` became unit variants `Http`/`ApiKey` with the inner fields gone, and the generated `From` impls fabricated `Default::default()` for every missing field — round-tripping any real value through Elixir produced empty defaults (silent data corruption). The backend now detects struct-variant enums and lowers them to `rustler::NifTaggedEnum` with the original variant fields preserved; the From impls now destructure variants instead of fabricating defaults. Unit-only enums continue to use `NifUnitEnum`.
- **WASM binding crate generation now sets `default-features = false` on the core dep when `[wasm].features` is configured.** Cargo would otherwise OR the explicit feature set with the core crate's defaults, sneaking host-only defaults like `download` back into the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build and failing on `getrandom`/`mio`.
- **`alef validate-versions` now normalizes per-format before comparing.** It applies `to_pep440` to the canonical version when reading `pyproject.toml`, applies `to_rubygems_prerelease` for Ruby `version.rb`, and skips manifests that exist but don't declare a `version` field (e.g. private pnpm workspace roots). Eliminates spurious mismatches like canonical `1.4.0rc8` vs Python `1.4.0rc8` vs Ruby `1.4.0.pre.rc.8`.

## [0.11.7] - 2026-04-28

A patch release that fixes Rust e2e codegen so optional string/bytes args are passed via `.as_deref()` (yielding `Option<&str>`/`Option<&[u8]>`) rather than `&Option<...>`.

### Fixed

- **Rust e2e codegen no longer generates `&mime_type` for an `Option<String>` argument when the target signature expects `Option<&str>`.** Previously `let mime_type = None;` followed by `extract_file(&path, &mime_type, ...)` produced an `expected Option<&str>, found &Option<_>` E0308 mismatch on every fixture using the `extract_file` call. Optional string args now bind to a typed `Option<String>`/`Option<Vec<u8>>` (so `None` resolves) and pass via `.as_deref()` (or `.as_ref().map(|v| v.as_slice())` for bytes). Non-string optional non-string args use `.as_ref()` to avoid moving the binding.

## [0.11.6] - 2026-04-28

A patch release that prevents the python e2e codegen from emitting test files for categories whose fixtures are 100% skipped for python.

### Fixed

- **Python e2e codegen no longer generates a `tests/test_<category>.py` file when every fixture in that category has `skip.languages` containing `"python"`.** Previously the emitter would still write the file with `@pytest.mark.skip` markers, but the file's `from kreuzberg import ...` line would then reference APIs that aren't bound in Python — failing at module import before pytest could honor the skip marker. The other language emitters (node, ruby, java, go, csharp, php, elixir, r, wasm, dart, gleam, kotlin, swift, zig, typescript) already filtered skipped fixtures upstream and were not affected.

## [0.11.5] - 2026-04-28

A patch release that fixes the GitHub-release existence check so the publish pipeline no longer skips its own builds when only a release tag exists with no binaries attached.

### Fixed

- **`alef check-registry --registry github-release` now optionally verifies asset presence.** Two new flags — `--asset-prefix <STR>` and `--required-assets <a,b,c>` — make the check fail (return `exists=false`) when the release tag exists but the requested binaries have not been uploaded yet. Without this, alef's own `check-github-release` job returned `exists=true` for v0.11.4's empty release (the tag had been created by `gh release create` before the build matrix uploaded artifacts) and the dependent build jobs skipped — producing another tag with no binaries. The action wrapper (`kreuzberg-dev/actions/check-registry`) already exposed `asset-prefix` and `assets` inputs but was previously dropping them on the floor.

## [0.11.4] - 2026-04-28

A patch release that ships v0.11.3's content plus a fix for alef's own publish pipeline. v0.11.3 tagged but never produced binaries because validate-versions aborted on a half-empty `alef.toml`.

### Fixed

- **`alef.toml` in this repo now carries the minimal `[crate]` section and `languages = []` that `load_config` requires.** `alef validate versions` (run by the publish workflow's pre-flight) was failing with `missing field crate`, causing the whole publish run to skip without ever building binaries. Without a `[crate]` table the parser refuses the file even though the subcommand only needs the canonical version from `Cargo.toml`. v0.11.0 through v0.11.3 all share this issue — none of those tags has binary assets on the release page; v0.11.4 is the first installable build of the v0.11.x line.

## [0.11.3] - 2026-04-28

A patch release that turns alef.toml's `version` field into a real lifecycle pin: writes are stamped on every successful generate, and a config pointing to a future alef now refuses to run instead of silently producing stale output.

### Added

- **`alef generate` and `alef all` enforce alef.toml ↔ CLI version compatibility.** Before doing any work, both commands parse the top-level `version = "X.Y.Z"` field (if set) and compare it semver-style against the running CLI. If the pin is greater than the CLI, the command aborts with `alef.toml pins version = "..." but installed alef CLI is X.Y.Z. Upgrade alef ...`. This catches the case where a downstream repo bumps `alef.toml` and tries to regenerate against an older binary still on disk — the regenerate would otherwise quietly skip new emitters and corrupt the output.
- **`alef generate` and `alef all` stamp alef.toml with the CLI version after a successful run.** The top-level `version = "..."` line is rewritten (or inserted if missing) to match `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`. Downstream consumers (install-alef, CI verify) now have an authoritative record of which alef produced the on-disk artifacts, so a mismatch between alef.toml and the headers in generated files becomes impossible. The rewrite is line-anchored, so dependency `version = "..."` specs inside inline tables are never touched.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-04-28

A patch release fixing the alef self-publish bootstrap and rolling up several major dependency upgrades.

### Fixed

- **`alef`'s own publish workflow no longer races against itself.** The `prepare`, `validate-versions`, and `check-registry` jobs use the alef-backed composite actions, which previously defaulted `alef-version: latest` — install-alef would resolve that to the just-bumped `alef.toml` pin (the very version being published) and try to download a binary that didn't exist yet (it's built later in the same run). All four alef-side action calls now pass `alef-version: main` so install-alef builds from source via `cargo install --git --locked`. Costs ~2-3 min per job but breaks the chicken-and-egg loop.

### Changed

- **`alef check-registry` ported to ureq v3.** The previous v2 API (`AgentBuilder`, `RequestBuilder::set`, `Error::Status(404, _)`, `Response::into_string`) was rewritten to the v3 equivalents (`Agent::config_builder().new_agent()`, `RequestBuilder::header`, `Error::StatusCode(404)`, `Response::into_body().read_to_string()`).

### Bumped (template_versions)

- `JUNIT` 5.14.4 → 6.0.3 (Maven scaffold templates)
- `MICROSOFT_NET_TEST_SDK` 17.14.1 → 18.4.0
- `XUNIT_RUNNER_VISUALSTUDIO` 2.8.2 → 3.1.5
- `PRE_COMMIT_HOOKS_REV` v0.9.5 → v6.0.0
- `TYPOS_REV` v0.7.10 → v1.45.2
- Plus auto-merged Renovate PRs landed since v0.11.1: `criterion` 0.7 → 0.8, `extendr-api` 0.8 → 0.9, `microsoft.net.test.sdk` 17.12.0 → 17.14.1, JVM tooling pins, pre-commit hook revisions.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-04-28

A patch release fixing path discovery and version-extraction edge cases in the new `alef validate versions` subcommand surfaced when running it against kreuzberg's repo layout.

### Fixed

- **`alef validate versions` now skips manifests that don't exist** rather than treating absence as a mismatch. Previously, every repo was flagged as having "missing" Ruby/Go/PHP manifests if it didn't follow alef's default lib-based layout. The check is opt-in per file: only manifests that physically exist are validated.
- **Ruby version files are discovered via globs** matching the same patterns alef's `sync-versions` writes to: `packages/ruby/lib/*/version.rb`, `packages/ruby/ext/*/src/*/version.rb`, `packages/ruby/ext/*/native/src/*/version.rb`. Repos that ship the Ruby gem with rb-sys-style ext layout no longer produce false negatives.
- **PHP composer.json is only validated when a `version` field is actually declared**. Composer relies on Git tags for versioning, and most polyglot manifests omit it; the validator no longer flags missing-by-design as a mismatch.
- **`mix.exs` reader now accepts both `@version "X.Y.Z"` (module-attribute form) and `version: "X.Y.Z"` (keyword form inside `def project do`).** The previous reader only matched the `@version` constant style.
- **Root `package.json` and `crates/{name}-{wasm,node}/package.json` are now part of the validation set.** Repos that ship a top-level npm package or per-crate package.json no longer silently bypass the check.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-28

A minor release that absorbs a large slice of polyglot publish-pipeline machinery into alef so consumers (kreuzberg, html-to-markdown, liter-llm, …) can stop duplicating it across `kreuzberg-dev/actions` shims and per-repo `scripts/publish/` shell. `alef-publish` now owns end-to-end packaging for seven languages it previously didn't, and the `alef` binary gains four new top-level subcommands that consolidate cross-manifest validation, release-event metadata extraction, multi-registry version checks, and Go submodule tagging.

### Added

- **`alef-publish` end-to-end packagers for Python, Wasm, Node, Ruby, Elixir, Java, and C#.** Each adds a `package_<lang>` function under `crates/alef-publish/src/package/` and is dispatched from `alef publish package --lang <lang> --target <triple>`. Python invokes maturin for wheels and sdist; Wasm runs `wasm-pack` then `npm pack`; Node runs `napi build` and emits per-platform npm sub-packages following the `napi.triples.additional` convention (with the platform list configurable via the new `[publish.languages.node].npm_subpackage_platforms`); Ruby compiles via rb-sys/`bundle exec rake compile` and assembles a platform-tagged `.gem`; Elixir produces RustlerPrecompiled-style NIF tarballs (one per `nif_versions` × target combination) plus a `checksum-Elixir.{App}.exs` aggregator; Java stages the JNI shared library under `native/{classifier}/` and runs Maven to produce a classifier-suffixed JAR; C# stages `runtimes/{rid}/native/` and runs `dotnet pack`.

- **`alef validate versions`** — cross-manifest version consistency checker. Reads `alef.toml` to discover each language's manifest location (Cargo.toml / pyproject.toml / package.json / gemspec / mix.exs / pom.xml / .csproj / composer.json / gleam.toml / build.zig / Package.swift / pubspec.yaml / build.gradle.kts / DESCRIPTION) and compares declared versions to the canonical Cargo.toml workspace version. Exits non-zero with a clear mismatch list; emits JSON with `--json`. Replaces the Python-based `kreuzberg-dev/actions/validate-versions` action and the per-repo shell scripts that did the same job.

- **`alef release-metadata`** — emits release metadata JSON in the exact shape consumed by GitHub Actions matrix dispatch (`tag`, `version`, `npm_tag`, `is_tag`, `is_prerelease`, `release_<target>` flags, …). Args: `--tag`, `--targets`, `--git-ref`, `--event`, `--dry-run`, `--force-republish`, `--json`. The set of valid targets is discovered from `alef.toml`'s `languages` array. Replaces `kreuzberg-dev/actions/prepare-release-metadata`.

- **`alef check-registry`** — version-existence check across PyPI, npm, crates.io, RubyGems, Hex, Maven Central, NuGet, Packagist, a Homebrew tap, and GitHub Releases. Output: `exists=true|false` (and JSON with `--json`). Replaces `kreuzberg-dev/actions/check-registry` plus the per-registry `scripts/publish/check_*.sh` scripts.

- **`alef go-tag`** — creates and pushes the two Git tags Go's submodule-versioning convention requires (the top-level `vX.Y.Z` and the `packages/go/v<major>/vX.Y.Z` submodule tag). Supports `--dry-run` and `--remote`.

- **`PublishLanguageConfig` schema additions** (all `Option<...>`, fully back-compatible): `npm_subpackage_platforms`, `cibuildwheel_environment`, `jni_classifier`, `csharp_rid`, `wheel`, `sdist`. Existing `[publish.languages.*]` tables continue to load unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Scaffolded GitHub workflows for Swift, Dart, Gleam, Kotlin, and Zig were broken on first run.** The Swift workflow referenced `actions/setup-swift@v4`, which doesn't exist (the working action is `swift-actions/setup-swift@v2`). The Dart, Gleam, Kotlin, and Zig workflows passed unsupported flags to the per-language CLIs (`--working-dir`, `--project-path`, `--directory`) instead of `cd`-ing into the package directory. All five workflow templates now use `defaults.run.working-directory: packages/<lang>` and let each CLI run from its own root, and Swift uses `swift-actions/setup-swift@v2`.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-04-27

A patch release fixing three orchestration / e2e-codegen bugs that surfaced during a clean `alef all --clean` regenerate of every downstream polyglot repo: standalone e2e Rust crates were getting absorbed into parent workspaces, the orchestrated `alef all` skipped the language-default formatter pass, and the Rust visitor codegen was producing unparsable trait-impl blocks.

### Fixed

- **e2e Rust crate's `Cargo.toml` was silently inherited by any parent workspace**, so running `cargo fmt`/`cargo build` from inside `e2e/rust/` failed with `current package believes it's in a workspace when it's not` whenever the consuming repo had a top-level workspace `Cargo.toml` that didn't explicitly list `e2e/rust` in `members` or `exclude`. The default formatter `(cd {dir} && cargo fmt --all)` therefore exited 1 and left `e2e/rust/tests/*.rs` unformatted, breaking the next `alef verify`. The generated `e2e/rust/Cargo.toml` now starts with an empty `[workspace]` table so the e2e crate is its own workspace root and is unaffected by any parent — consumers no longer have to remember to add `e2e/rust` to `workspace.exclude`.

- **`alef all` skipped `format_generated`**, leaving every language-default formatter (mix format, ruff format, biome format, php-cs-fixer, etc.) unrun on the freshly emitted bindings. Prek's check-mode formatting hooks (`mix format --check-formatted`, etc.) therefore failed against `packages/elixir/lib/<lib>/native.ex` and similar files in every repo that ran the orchestrated `alef all` instead of `alef generate`. `Commands::All` now invokes `pipeline::format_generated` before `fmt_post_generate`, mirroring the order in `alef generate`.

- **e2e Rust visitor codegen emitted untyped trait method parameters** (`fn visit_custom_element(&self, ctx, tag_name, html) -> VisitResult`), producing files that could not parse. Three coupled fixes:
  - Each visitor parameter is now bound to a `_` pattern with the explicit `&NodeContext` / `&str` / `bool` / `u8` / `u32` / `Option<&str>` / `&[String]` type from the `HtmlVisitor` trait, so the body needn't introduce unused bindings.
  - The receiver is now `&mut self` to match the trait, not `&self`.
  - `CallbackAction::Custom` was missing the surrounding string-literal quotes — `VisitResult::Custom([CUSTOM WIDGET].to_string())` was the literal output for `output: "[CUSTOM WIDGET]"`. The codegen now wraps the escaped value in `"…"` before calling `.to_string()`, so the emitted expression is a well-formed `&str` literal.
  - The test file now imports `HtmlVisitor`, `NodeContext`, and `VisitResult` whenever any fixture in the file declares a `visitor` block.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-04-27

A patch release fixing `alef e2e generate` so it only emits test projects for languages the consumer has actually scaffolded, plus two `alef verify`-vs-`prek` drift fixes uncovered by a clean v0.10.2 regenerate of the downstream polyglot repos.

### Fixed

- **`alef e2e generate` emitted test projects for every supported backend** when neither `--lang` nor `[e2e].languages` was set, including languages with no scaffolded binding (e.g. `gleam`, `kotlin`, `dart`, `swift`, `zig`, `brew`). The resulting `e2e/<lang>/` directories couldn't compile because the package they reference doesn't exist. The default now mirrors `alef generate` / `alef scaffold`: derive the e2e language list from the top-level `[languages]` array, mapping `Language::Ffi` → the `c` e2e harness and always including `rust` for the source-crate suite. Generators without a matching `Language` variant (`brew`) require explicit opt-in via `[e2e].languages`.

  Migration: after upgrading, run `alef e2e generate` once, then manually delete any stale `e2e/<lang>/` directories for languages you never scaffolded — the cleanup pass only revisits dirs the current run touched, so untouched stale dirs from prior runs are not auto-removed.

- **e2e Rust default formatter command was invalid**: v0.10.2 introduced a built-in default of `cargo fmt --manifest-path {dir}/Cargo.toml`, but `--manifest-path` is not a stable global flag for `cargo fmt` (cargo prints `Specify message-format: short|json|human / --all / --check` and exits 1). The default is now `(cd {dir} && cargo fmt --all)`, which formats the standalone e2e crate from inside its own directory and works regardless of whether the crate is a workspace member. Without this fix, `e2e/rust/tests/*.rs` were left unformatted by `alef e2e generate`, and prek's cargo-fmt hook then rewrote them post-finalisation, breaking `alef verify`.

- **`normalize_content` skipped trailing-whitespace stripping for `.rs` files** when rustfmt could not parse them — for example, cextendr's `packages/r/src/rust/src/lib.rs` uses the non-standard `name: T = "default"` parameter-default syntax, which rustfmt rejects, so `format_rust_content` falls back to the raw codegen output. The raw output contains trailing whitespace on blank lines (e.g. `    \n` between `#[must_use]` and the next `pub fn`), which prek's `trailing-whitespace` hook then strips, breaking `alef verify`. `normalize_content` now always pipes through `normalize_whitespace` after rustfmt, so the embedded `alef:hash` always reflects whitespace-clean content regardless of whether rustfmt parsed the file.

### Added

- **`alef_e2e::default_e2e_languages(&[Language])`** — the public helper that maps the scaffolded language list to e2e generator names. Exposed so consumers and downstream tooling can resolve the same default the CLI uses.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-04-27

A patch release fixing four codegen and pipeline bugs surfaced by a clean regenerate of the five downstream polyglot repos against v0.10.1.

### Fixed

- **Swift binding `Cargo.toml` was missing `serde_json`** even though the generated `lib.rs` emitted `::serde_json::to_value(...)` / `::serde_json::from_value(...)` calls for `Codable` propagation, breaking compilation with ~1k+ `E0433: cannot find serde_json in the crate root` errors. The Swift backend now always includes `serde_json = "1"` in the binding crate's `[dependencies]`.
- **Dart binding `Cargo.toml` listed an unused `anyhow = "1"`** — the Dart trait-bridge codegen returns `source_crate::Result<T>` directly and never imports anyhow, so `cargo machete` rejected the crate. The Dart backend's `extra_deps` no longer emits anyhow.
- **Go e2e codegen emitted fixture strings containing NUL bytes inside raw string literals** (`` `…\0…` ``), which `gofmt` rejects with `illegal character NUL`. Affected ~50 generated test files in repos with NUL-bearing fixture data. The `go_string_literal` helper now switches to interpreted (double-quoted) form whenever a string contains characters Go raw strings cannot represent (NUL, `\r`, or backtick), and emits `\xNN` hex escapes for any ASCII control byte.
- **e2e generated files drifted from their embedded `alef:hash` after `prek run --all-files`** because `alef e2e generate` skipped trailing-newline / trailing-whitespace normalization and didn't run a Rust or Python formatter on standalone e2e manifests by default. Three coupled fixes:
  - `pipeline::write_scaffold_files_with_overwrite` now runs every emitted file through `normalize_content` (ensure exactly one trailing newline, strip trailing whitespace per line) before hash finalization, matching what `prek`'s `end-of-file-fixer` and `trailing-whitespace` hooks would have done.
  - `alef-e2e::format::run_formatters` now falls back to a built-in default formatter set (`cargo fmt` inside `e2e/rust/`, `ruff format` on `e2e/python/`) when `[e2e].format` is unconfigured, instead of silently no-oping.
  - `pipeline::sync_versions` now invokes `finalize_hashes` on every version-synced file (e.g. `version.rb`) so the embedded `alef:hash` line stays consistent with the rewritten content.



A patch release reworking `alef verify` to be **idempotent across alef versions** and bundling six small generator/scaffold fixes that landed since v0.10.0. The verify hash no longer encodes the alef CLI version or `alef.toml`; it is now a per-file fingerprint derived purely from the rust sources and the on-disk file content, so a green `alef verify` stays green after upgrading the alef CLI as long as nothing else changed.

### Changed

- **`alef verify` is now per-file source+output deterministic**. The `alef:hash:<hex>` line embedded in every generated file is computed as `blake3(sources_hash || file_content_without_hash_line)`, where `sources_hash = blake3(sorted(rust_source_files))` — no alef version dimension, no `alef.toml` dimension. `alef generate` finalises the hash *after* every formatter has run (so the embedded hash describes the actual on-disk byte content), and `alef verify` is now a pure read+strip+rehash+compare with no regeneration and no writes. Previously the hash incorporated the alef CLI version, which forced every consumer repo to re-run `alef generate` after every alef bump even when nothing else had changed.
- **`alef_core::hash::compute_generation_hash` is removed**; use `compute_sources_hash` + `compute_file_hash` instead. The IR cache (`.alef/ir.json`) now keys on `compute_sources_hash` alone — pass `--clean` to bust the cache when the alef extractor itself has changed.
- **`pipeline::write_files` / `write_scaffold_files` no longer take a `generation_hash` argument**; the hash is finalised separately by the new `pipeline::finalize_hashes(paths, sources_hash)` after formatters run.

  Migration: after upgrading, every existing alef-generated file still carries the old input-deterministic hash. Run `alef generate` once (then `alef e2e generate` if the repo uses `[e2e]`) to refresh embedded hashes to the new per-file scheme.

### Fixed

- **`alef scaffold` emitted Dart and Swift `Cargo.toml` files without a `license` field and pulled in an unused `serde_json` dep** — both languages now emit the same `license = "..."` line as the other backends, and the spurious `serde_json = "1"` is gone.
- **Go e2e fixtures used raw `to_pascal_case` for method names** instead of routing through `to_go_name`, so generated test code referenced `result.Html` while the binding declared `result.HTML` (golangci-lint rejected the package). All Go method emission now goes through `alef_codegen::naming::to_go_name`.
- **Dart codegen emitted reserved keywords / numeric idents / unescaped `$` and `\`** in field names, parameter names, and string literals — Dart now escapes reserved keywords (`async`, `class`, …), prefixes leading-digit identifiers with `_`, and escapes `$` / `\` / `"` inside generated string literals.
- **`alef readme` panicked when a snippet section was missing from the language template** — missing snippet keys default to an empty Tera object instead of raising.
- **`fmt_post_generate` did not run the configured formatters for WASM, C#, and Java** because the lint/format dispatch was hardcoded to a static set of languages — the dispatch is now driven entirely by `LintConfig::format` so any backend can opt in.
- **NAPI `.d.ts` emission placed optional parameters before required ones**, which TypeScript rejects with `TS1016`. NAPI generators now reorder optional parameters last in the emitted `.d.ts` signatures.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-27

A major release expanding alef's target-language coverage from 11 to 16 backends. Adds full code-generation support for **Kotlin** (JNA), **Swift** (swift-bridge), **Dart** (flutter_rust_bridge), **Gleam** (Rustler-on-BEAM), and **Zig** (C ABI), each with scaffold, lint, format, build, test, setup, update, and clean defaults wired through `alef-core`. The five new backends share the existing IR, trait-bridge round-trip API, and `alef-docs` language-native doc emission paths — there is no per-language fork of the codegen pipeline. Also adds language-native doc comments (PHPDoc, C# XML, `@doc`, roxygen2) to the existing PHP/C#/Elixir/R backends, and fills in numerous correctness gaps surfaced by the kreuzberg verification worktree.

### Added

- **Five new language backends** — `alef-backend-kotlin`, `alef-backend-swift`, `alef-backend-dart`, `alef-backend-gleam`, `alef-backend-zig`. Each implements the `Backend` trait, ships per-crate snapshot tests via `insta`, and is wired into `alef-cli`'s dispatch table. Trait bridges are supported across all five (Dart abstract classes, Gleam per-method response shims, Zig comptime `make_*_vtable` helpers, Kotlin/Swift host-side typealiases + Codable propagation).
- **Language-native scaffolds for the new backends** — `alef-scaffold` writes Kotlin (Gradle KTS + Detekt + ktlint), Swift (Swift Package Manager + swift-format + SwiftLint), Dart (pub + flutter_rust_bridge + lints), Gleam (`gleam.toml` + gleeunit), and Zig (`build.zig` + `build.zig.zon`) toolchain configs, README stubs, and CI templates. `alef-publish` gains per-language packaging and validation modules for the same five.
- **`alef-docs` language emitters for PHP/C#/Elixir/R/Kotlin/Swift/Dart/Gleam/Zig** — PHPDoc, XML `<summary>`/`<param>`/`<returns>`, Elixir `@doc` heredocs, roxygen2 `@param`/`@return`, KDoc, Swift markdown, Dart `///`, Gleam `///`, and Zig `///` are now emitted for all public functions/methods. Shared `doc_emission` module handles language-specific escaping (e.g. `*/` in PHP, XML entities in C#, triple-quote escapes in Elixir).
- **`has_serde` IR flag on `EnumDef`** — extracted from `derive(Serialize)` + `derive(Deserialize)` so backends can decide whether to JSON-roundtrip or pattern-match conversion. Used by Swift to emit `Codable` and propagate it to non-derived enum references whose containing struct is `Codable`.
- **`return_sanitized` IR flag on `FunctionDef`** — laid down by `alef-extract` when the return type was sanitized by the unknown-type pass. Backends can use it to decide whether a roundtrip is recoverable for the return value (currently consumed by snapshot/doc tests; full backend wiring is a follow-up).
- **`alef-readme` v0.10.0 README templates** for the new languages.

### Changed

- **Backend count: 11 → 16** in README, skill docs, and the supported-languages table. Kotlin/Swift/Dart/Gleam/Zig are no longer flagged "in progress".
- **Trait bridges span all 16 backends** — round-trip callbacks (host language implements a trait, Rust core invokes it through the bridge) work end-to-end for every supported language.
- **`alef-core::config` defaults** for `LintConfig`, `BuildConfig`, `TestConfig`, `SetupConfig`, `UpdateConfig`, and `CleanConfig` now cover Kotlin/Swift/Dart/Gleam/Zig with per-language preconditions and command sequences. The Phase-1 skip clauses in the per-language test loops are gone.
- **Centralized version pins** — `alef-core::template_versions` gains `pub_dev`, `toolchain`, and Kotlin/Swift entries in `cargo`/`maven` modules. Toolchain pins (Zig 0.16, Dart SDK `>=3.0 <4.0`, JVM 21, swift-bridge `0.1.59`, flutter_rust_bridge `2.12.0`, Kotlin 2.1.10, kotlinx-coroutines 1.9.0, JNA 5.14.0) are now single-source.

### Fixed

- **Swift typealias closure for #59** — non-trait Kreuzberg types are emitted as `typealias Kreuzberg.X = RustBridge.X`, host-language wrapper functions are removed, and consumers call `RustBridge` functions directly. `RustString`/`RustVec` returns and `Data → [UInt8]` arguments are converted at the wrapper boundary. Conversion initializers (`init(rustVal: RustBridge.X)`) are emitted for non-`Codable` enums; `Codable` enums skip them and use JSON. `swift_name(camelCase)` is emitted on every bridge fn so swift-bridge generates idiomatic Swift symbols. Reduces `kreuzberg-swift` build errors from ~190 to 0.
- **Swift unbridgeable surfaces** — getters/wrappers for fields that can't survive the swift-bridge round-trip (excluded fields, JSON containers with non-serde inners, `Vec<non-Primitive>` in non-serde structs) now skip emission entirely with a `// alef: skipped` marker instead of emitting `unimplemented!()`.
- **Swift constructor / lints / keyword escaping** — constructor is omitted (instead of `unimplemented!()`) for structs that need `Default` but don't derive it. Generated `lib.rs` carries an `#![allow]` block for the swift-bridge codegen pattern's clippy artifacts. Reserved Swift keywords used as field/param names are escaped at the extern block, wrapper, and constructor sites. A phantom `Vec<FooBox>` accessor is forced per trait so swift-bridge emits the C symbols its Vec<T> accessors call.
- **Dart trait abstract classes + unbridgeable surfaces** — Dart-side `abstract class` is emitted per trait for the round-trip API. Functions with unbridgeable params (e.g. `Vec<(Vec<u8>, …)>`, lossy through JSON) are skipped instead of emitting panicking shims. Tuple-variant fields are renamed `_N` → `fieldN` to survive flutter_rust_bridge's underscore stripping. Generator-only clippy lints (`map_identity`, `let_and_return`, `collapsible_match`, `manual_flatten`, `too_many_arguments`, `unit_arg`, `type_complexity`) are silenced via `#![allow]` in the emitted `lib.rs`.
- **Gleam per-method response shims** — each trait method gets a typed `{trait}_{method}_response(call_id, Result(T, E))` shim so callback modules can reply through the Rustler reply-registry without raw JSON.
- **Zig vtable codegen** — comptime `make_{trait}_vtable(comptime T, *T)` helper generated per trait bridge; thunks reconstruct byte slices, fallible methods return `i32 + out_error`, lifecycle stubs (`name_fn`, `version_fn`, `initialize_fn`, `shutdown_fn`) emitted when `super_trait` is configured. Trait-bridge thunks now discard unused `out_result` params, avoid shadowing method params named `result`, and only emit `return 0;` when the success path actually flows through.
- **WASM `useless_conversion`** — generated `lib.rs` adds the lint to its crate-wide allow list, since the `kreuzberg::T::from(t_core).into()` identity conversion is only an artifact of code generation.
- **Rustler doc emission** — NIF Rust source emits standard `///` Rustdoc instead of literal Elixir `@doc """…"""` heredocs (which produced 380 parse errors when run through `cargo build`). Reserved Elixir module-attribute names (`@behaviour`, `@callback`, …) are no longer used as GenServer attributes. The lossy `Vec<String>` → `Vec<&str>` conversion is dropped — `&Vec<T>` already derefs to `&[T]`, so the simpler emission preserves caller signatures like `&[String]`.
- **Swift scaffold indent** — Swift test stubs use 2-space indent to match swift-format defaults.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-27

A patch fixing three generator bugs that surfaced when alef v0.9.1 was used to regenerate downstream consumer repos. Each one blocked a different language's pre-commit hook from passing on freshly regenerated bindings; with these fixes a full `alef generate` + `alef e2e generate` produces output that passes mix credo (Elixir), golangci-lint (Go), and `dotnet format` / `dotnet build` (C#) without further hand-editing.

### Fixed

- **Elixir trait-bridge module names emitted broken PascalCase for hyphenated crate names**: `alef-scaffold`'s Elixir generator used `capitalize_first(&app_name)`, which only uppercased the first character and left underscores in place. For a crate named `html-to-markdown` the generated Rustler trait bridge declared `defmodule Html_to_markdownHtmlVisitorBridge do`, which `mix credo` correctly rejects ("Module names should be written in PascalCase."). All three call sites (mix.exs `defmodule`, the bridge `module_name`, and `native_mod`) now use `heck::ToPascalCase`, splitting on both `-` and `_`. `html-to-markdown` → `HtmlToMarkdown`, `tree-sitter-language-pack` → `TreeSitterLanguagePack`.
- **Go binding and Go e2e tests disagreed on initialism casing**: `alef-backend-go` already routes Go field/parameter names through an idiomatic-initialism transformer (`HTML`, `URL`, `ID`, `JSON`, …) but `alef-e2e`'s Go fixture renderer used a plain `to_pascal_case` helper, so generated test code referenced `result.Html` and `result.Url` while the binding declared `HTML` and `URL`. golangci-lint rejected the generated package with "result.Html undefined". Both crates now route through `alef_codegen::naming::to_go_name` and `go_param_name`; the duplicate `GO_INITIALISMS` table in `alef-e2e/src/codegen/go.rs` was deleted.
- **C# `.csproj` scaffold was placed inside the source subdirectory instead of the package root**: `alef-scaffold` wrote the project file at `packages/csharp/{Namespace}/{Namespace}.csproj`, but consumer Taskfile targets and the prek `csharp-format` / `csharp-lint` hooks expected it at `packages/csharp/{Namespace}.csproj` (alongside `Directory.Build.props`, matching the convention used for the gemspec at `packages/ruby/*.gemspec`). The path is now `packages/csharp/{Namespace}.csproj`, with `<ItemGroup>` `Include` paths adjusted (one level up the relative path) so `LICENSE` and `runtimes/**` still resolve correctly. The scaffold remains create-once.
- **C# async docs/signature emitted invalid `Task<void>`**: `alef-docs::render_csharp_fn_sig` formatted async return types as `Task<{ret}>` unconditionally, so for void-returning async functions the documented signature read `public static async Task<void> ...`, which doesn't compile under `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>`. It now emits `Task` for void returns and `Task<{ret}>` otherwise.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-27

A patch release fixing the publish pipeline. v0.9.0 (and prior releases since `alef-publish` was added) failed to publish `alef-cli` to crates.io because `alef-publish` was missing from the publish workflow's crate list — `alef-cli` declares `alef-publish = "^X.Y.Z"` and crates.io still served `alef-publish 0.7.2`, so the upload of `alef-cli` errored with `failed to select a version for the requirement alef-publish = "^0.9.0"`. The 19 other workspace crates published cleanly each time; only `alef-cli` (the binary used by `cargo install` / `cargo binstall`) was affected. v0.9.0 was rescued by publishing `alef-publish` and `alef-cli` manually with `cargo publish`; v0.9.1 makes the workflow self-sufficient.

### Fixed

- **`alef-publish` was missing from the Publish workflow's crate list**: `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` listed 20 crates but not `alef-publish`, so the workflow never uploaded it to crates.io. `alef-cli`'s dependency on `alef-publish ^X.Y.Z` therefore failed to resolve at publish time. The crate is now listed in dependency order (after `alef-scaffold`, before the backends), matching the rest of the workspace.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-27

A major fix release eliminating ~40 generated "Not implemented" stubs across the PHP, Ruby, C FFI, and R backends. Every batch extraction API (`batch_extract_file_sync`, `batch_extract_bytes_sync`, plus async variants), `extract_file`/`extract_file_sync`, and most of the Ruby gem's surface previously failed at runtime with error code 99. Five distinct generator bugs collapsed into a single class of bad output. Also makes `alef verify` input-deterministic so downstream formatters can reformat generated content freely without breaking verify, and exposes the canonical input-hash recipe via `alef_core::hash::compute_generation_hash`.

### Changed

- **`alef verify` is now input-deterministic**. The embedded `alef:hash:<hex>` line in every generated file is no longer a per-file hash of the normalised generated content; it is a single fingerprint of the **inputs** that produced the run:
  - `blake3(sorted(rust_source_files) + alef.toml + alef_version)`

  `alef generate` computes this hash once and writes the same value into every alef-headered file. `alef verify` recomputes the same input hash and compares it to the disk hash without inspecting any file body. As a result, downstream formatters (rustfmt, rubocop, dotnet format, spotless, biome, mix format, php-cs-fixer, taplo, ruff, …) can reformat alef-generated content freely without breaking verify — only changes to the generation inputs invalidate the embedded hash. The previous output-deterministic semantics caused `alef verify` to flag bindings as stale on every commit in repos with active language formatters.

  Migration: after upgrading, every existing alef-generated file still carries the old per-file hash. Run `alef generate` once (then `alef e2e generate` if the repo uses `[e2e]`) to refresh all embedded hashes — a single regenerate pass writes the new uniform input hash everywhere.

- **`alef verify` ignores `--lang`, `--compile`, `--lint`**. The flags are still accepted for backwards compatibility but no longer affect the check, since verify no longer regenerates per-language. Use `alef build`, `alef lint`, `alef test` for those concerns.

### Added

- **`alef_core::hash::compute_generation_hash(sources, config_path, alef_version)`** — public function exposing the canonical input-hash recipe so other consumers (cache invalidation, custom build tools) can reuse it. `alef-cli`'s `cache::generation_hash` is now a thin wrapper passing `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` for the version dimension.

### Fixed

- **Bare `Path` resolved to `Named("Path")` and silently sanitized to `String`**: `alef-extract`'s `resolve_path_type` only recognized `PathBuf` (and `&Path` via the reference path). Functions taking `path: impl AsRef<Path>` resolved the inner generic arg `Path` to `Named("Path")`, then `sanitize_unknown_types` (which considers stdlib `Path` an unknown user type) replaced it with `TypeRef::String` and marked the param as sanitized. The result was that every binding emitted "Not implemented" stubs for `extract_file`, `extract_file_sync`, and any other API using `impl AsRef<Path>`. Bare `Path` now maps to `TypeRef::Path` like `PathBuf`.
- **PHP backend stubbed sanitized functions even when the params were JSON-roundtripable**: `alef-backend-php`'s `gen_function_body` short-circuited to `gen_stub_return` whenever `func.sanitized` was true, ignoring the existing serde-roundtrip helper. `gen_php_serde_let_bindings`, `gen_php_named_let_bindings`, and `gen_php_call_args_with_let_bindings` now handle `Vec<String>` params that came from `Vec<tuple>` (each element is a JSON-encoded tuple), and the function/method body generators fall through to the serde path when a recovery is possible. Affects all batch APIs (`batch_extract_*`).
- **Magnus (Ruby) backend stubbed every extraction function**: the shared `can_auto_delegate_function` rejected functions with a non-opaque Named ref param (e.g. `&ExtractionConfig`), so `extract_bytes`, `extract_bytes_sync`, and 19 other functions emitted "Not implemented" stubs even though the existing deser-preamble could handle them. `alef-backend-magnus` now adds a magnus-specific `magnus_serde_recoverable` gate that allows JSON-roundtrip on Named non-opaque params and on sanitized `Vec<String>` (originally `Vec<tuple>`), and uses `gen_call_args_with_let_bindings` so the call site borrows `&{name}_core` correctly.
- **C FFI backend stubbed all functions with sanitized params**: `alef-backend-ffi` set `will_be_unimplemented = func.sanitized` and bailed out before parameter conversion, even though the existing `Vec` JSON deserialization path could handle `Vec<String>` params with type inference at the call site. The FFI now exempts sanitized functions from the unimplemented bail-out when every sanitized param is a recoverable `Vec<String>` (with `original_type` set), routing them through the standard JSON-roundtrip Vec conversion. Affects `kreuzberg_batch_extract_*` and other tuple-batch FFI exports consumed by the Go, Java, and C# bindings.
- **R (extendr) backend panicked with `todo!("async not supported by backend")` for every async function**: extendr was configured with `AsyncPattern::None`. R is single-threaded but async functions are still callable from R via a per-call tokio runtime. The backend now uses `AsyncPattern::TokioBlockOn` and reports `supports_async: true`, generating `tokio::runtime::Runtime::new()?.block_on(...)` wrappers like the other sync-on-async backends.

### Known limitations

- Functions whose return type is a Named struct from outside the API surface (e.g. `get_preset` returning `&'static EmbeddingPreset`) are still stubbed: alef has no way to know whether the core type derives `Serialize`, so it can't safely JSON-roundtrip the value back to the binding side. The new `return_sanitized` IR field is laid down for a future fix.

## [0.8.7] - 2026-04-27

A patch fixing a CI-hang in the C# `alef setup` default and replacing the `// TODO: add usage example` placeholder in alef-generated READMEs with a pointer to the main repository docs.

### Fixed

- **`alef setup --lang csharp` walks the entire repo when no .csproj is at the top level**: `dotnet restore packages/csharp` searches for project files recursively under the given directory, including `target/`, `node_modules/`, and other artifact dirs. On CI this took longer than the 600s timeout. The C# setup default now applies the same precondition + `find` strategy as the upgrade default — both `dotnet` and a discoverable `.sln`/`.csproj` (depth 3) must exist, otherwise setup is skipped, and the resolved project path is passed explicitly to `dotnet restore`.
- **README usage examples were `// TODO: add usage example` placeholders**: the alef-generated per-language READMEs in the FFI/WASM crate dirs and `packages/{lang}/` for hardcoded fallbacks now redirect readers to the main repository's documentation instead of emitting a literal TODO.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-04-27

A patch hardening the C# upgrade default introduced in v0.8.5. The original `$(ls ... || find ... || echo …)` chain didn't actually skip when no project file existed — `ls foo/*.csproj 2>/dev/null` always exits 0 with empty stdout, so the `||` fallbacks never triggered and `dotnet outdated` ran with no path argument and errored out at the repo root.

### Fixed

- **C# upgrade falls through and fails when no `.csproj` exists**: alef-core's `update_defaults.rs` C# precondition now requires BOTH `dotnet` AND a discoverable `.sln`/`.csproj` under the output dir (depth 3). When no project exists, the upgrade is skipped (precondition warning) instead of erroring out. The command itself is simplified to just `find … | head -1`, which the precondition has already validated returns a path.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-04-27

A patch fixing two `alef update --latest` (`task upgrade`) failures observed across all four consumer repos.

### Fixed

- **Java `versions:use-latest-releases` aborted on missing rules file**: `alef-core/src/config/update_defaults.rs` unconditionally appended `-Dmaven.version.rules=file://${PWD}/{output_dir}/versions-rules.xml`, but most consumers don't ship that file. Maven aborted with `ResourceDoesNotExistException`, failing the whole upgrade pipeline. The flag is now wrapped in `$([ -f .../versions-rules.xml ] && echo "...")` so it's only appended when the file exists.
- **C# `dotnet outdated packages/csharp` rejected the directory**: `dotnet outdated` requires a `.sln` or `.csproj` path, or a directory that contains one at the top level. Most consumers nest projects under `packages/csharp/<ProjectName>/`, so the call failed with "The directory 'packages/csharp' does not contain any solutions or projects." The default now resolves to the first `.sln`/`.csproj` found under the output dir (depth 3) before invoking `dotnet outdated`.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-04-27

A follow-up to v0.8.3 fixing two cases where downstream tooling reformatted alef-generated `crates/{lib}-wasm/Cargo.toml` and silently invalidated the alef hash header.

### Fixed

- **WASM `Cargo.toml` cargo-sort canonical layout**: `alef-backend-wasm`'s `gen_cargo_toml` previously emitted `[lib]`/`[dependencies]` *before* the `[package.metadata.*]` blocks and listed dependencies in declaration order. cargo-sort, run as a pre-commit hook in every consumer, then rewrote the file in canonical alphabetical / TOML-section order — invalidating the embedded `alef:hash:` line, so the next `alef verify` reported the wasm Cargo.toml as stale on every commit. The template now emits sections and dependencies in cargo-sort canonical order (`[package]` → `[package.metadata.*]` → `[lib]` → `[dependencies]` sorted alphabetically including the dynamic core crate dep), so cargo-sort is a no-op.
- **WASM cargo-machete unused-dep flag for `serde_json`**: the wasm `Cargo.toml` always declared `serde_json = "1"` because trait-bridge / function generators may use it, but consumers without those code paths would fail `cargo-machete` on every commit. Added `serde_json` to the existing `[package.metadata.cargo-machete] ignored` list alongside the already-ignored `futures-util` and `wasm-bindgen-futures`.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-04-26

A follow-up to v0.8.2 making `alef verify` formatter-agnostic and fixing the Ruby version-sync footgun. Verify is now a pure hash comparison: alef computes the canonical hash at generation time, embeds it in the file header, and on `alef verify` only compares the embedded hash against a freshly-computed hash of the canonicalised generated content. External formatters (php-cs-fixer, rubocop, ruff, biome, …) can reformat the body freely without ever causing a verify diff.

### Changed

- **`alef verify` is now hash-only.** The legacy "diff against on-disk content" path is removed. Generated files carry an `alef:hash:<blake3>` header line; verify reads that hash and compares against the hash of the freshly-generated canonical content. No file body inspection, no normalization-against-disk, no formatter sensitivity. Files without an alef hash header (user-owned scaffolds like `Cargo.toml`, `composer.json`) are skipped — alef has no claim over them.
- **`alef generate` auto-runs `sync_versions`** at the end of every run, so user-owned manifests (gemspec, composer.json, package.json, etc.) track `Cargo.toml` automatically without a separate `alef sync-versions` invocation.

### Fixed

- **Ruby version.rb double-conversion via `[sync].extra_paths`**: when consumers listed `version.rb` in `[sync].extra_paths` (a common pattern for non-default extension layouts), the generic `SEMVER_RE.replace_all` matched the `0.3.0` prefix of the gem-formatted `0.3.0.pre.rc.2` and replaced it with the cargo dash-form `0.3.0-rc.2`, producing the corrupted `VERSION = "0.3.0-rc.2.pre.rc.2"`. The extra-paths handler now recognises `version.rb` and `*.gemspec` filenames and applies the gem-aware replacer (`to_rubygems_prerelease` + targeted regex) instead of the generic semver regex.
- **Ruby gemspec/version.rb gem format**: scaffold (`alef-scaffold`) and binding writer (`alef-backend-magnus`) now both call `alef_core::version::to_rubygems_prerelease` so cargo prereleases like `0.3.0-rc.2` are emitted as RubyGems-canonical `0.3.0.pre.rc.2`. RubyGems rejects the dash form (`gem build` raises `Gem::Version "0.3.0-rc.2" is not a valid version`).
- **PHP stub PSR-12 blank line**: generated `.phpstub` files now emit `<?php\n\n` so php-cs-fixer doesn't reformat the file on every commit.

### Added

- **`alef_core::version` module**: `to_rubygems_prerelease(version: &str) -> String` extracted from the CLI's `pipeline::version` so backends and scaffolds can reuse it without duplicating the conversion logic.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-04-26

A follow-up release to v0.8.1 fixing post-generation formatter invocation. Generated bindings now reliably pass `cargo fmt --check` and `ruff check` in CI.

### Fixed

- **FFI cargo fmt silently no-op'd**: `format_generated` ran `cargo fmt` in `packages/ffi/`, which has no `Cargo.toml`. Generated `crates/{lib}-ffi/src/lib.rs` was therefore never formatted, and CI's `cargo fmt --all -- --check` failed on diffs like `use std::ffi::{CStr, CString, c_char};` vs the rustfmt-canonical `use std::ffi::{c_char, CStr, CString};`. Now runs `cargo fmt --all` from the project root, which formats every generated Rust crate (FFI, PyO3, NAPI-RS, Magnus, ext-php-rs, Rustler, wasm-bindgen) in the consumer workspace.
- **Python ruff missed lint autofixes**: only `ruff format` was run, so generated stubs/wrappers retained `I001` unsorted imports, `F401` unused imports (e.g. `Any`), stale `# noqa: F401` comments on used imports, and `TC008` missing `TypeAlias` annotations on union aliases. `format_generated` now runs `ruff check --fix .` before `ruff format .` in `packages/python/`.
- **Ruby formatter wrong tool**: ran `cargo fmt` in `packages/ruby/`, which has no `Cargo.toml` (the Magnus crate lives under `packages/ruby/ext/{lib}_rb/native/` and is covered by the FFI-driven `cargo fmt --all`). Now runs `rubocop -A --no-server` in `packages/ruby/` to auto-correct generated `.rb` and `.gemspec` files.
- **R formatter wrong tool**: ran `cargo fmt` in `packages/r/`. Now runs `Rscript -e "styler::style_pkg('packages/r')"`.
- **WASM formatter scope tightened**: was `cargo fmt` in `packages/wasm/` (works because the wasm-bindgen crate lives there). Now uses `cargo fmt -p wasm` so the explicit package selection survives if package layout changes.

### Changed

- `FormatterSpec` now holds a `&'static [FormatterCommand]` instead of a single command, so a language can run multiple formatter steps in sequence (used by Python's `ruff check --fix` → `ruff format`). On first failure within a sequence the remaining steps are skipped (warning logged) — formatter errors never fail `alef generate`.
- `work_dir: ""` is now treated as the project root (no path join), so language-agnostic invocations like `cargo fmt --all` can run from the consumer's workspace root.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-26

A follow-up release to v0.8.0 focused on closing remaining clippy/build-correctness gaps surfaced by Kreuzberg's full workspace build. All alef-generated bindings (Python, Node, Ruby, PHP, FFI, WASM, Elixir, R, Go, Java, C#) now compile cleanly with `-D warnings` against the kreuzberg verification worktree. Adds an `is_copy` IR flag so the FFI backend can correctly distinguish Copy enums from Clone-but-not-Copy data-bearing enums.

### Added

- **`is_copy` IR flag on `TypeDef` and `EnumDef`**: extracted from `#[derive(Copy)]`. Lets backends distinguish Copy types from Clone-but-not-Copy types when emitting field accessors and method returns.

### Fixed

- **WASM trait-bridge regression**: shared `gen_bridge_trait_impl` emitted `#[async_trait::async_trait]` unconditionally, but `kreuzberg-wasm` has no `async_trait` dep. On non-wasm32 targets the trait declaration uses `#[cfg_attr(not(target_arch = "wasm32"), async_trait)]`, producing E0195 lifetime mismatches and E0433 missing-crate errors. WASM trait bridges now compile inside a private `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` mod with a public re-export — the bridge is wasm-only by nature (wraps `wasm_bindgen::JsValue`), so host workspace builds skip the impl entirely. The same `cfg(target_arch="wasm32")` gate is also applied to bridge-using free functions.
- **WASM scaffold deps**: generated `kreuzberg-wasm/Cargo.toml` now ensures `js-sys` is present, and serde-style `Vec<&str>` parameters are correctly bridged via `serde_wasm_bindgen` instead of failing JsValue→Vec deserialization.
- **FFI clone-on-copy lints (~25 occurrences)**: field accessors and method returns previously emitted `Box::into_raw(Box::new(obj.field.clone()))` for every Named-typed field, tripping `clippy::clone_on_copy` on the `Copy` enums (`TableModel`, `ChunkerType`, `LayoutClass`, `BBox`, etc.). Codegen now consults `enum.is_copy` / `type.is_copy` to emit auto-copy/deref for Copy types and `.clone()` for Clone-but-not-Copy types. Non-Clone opaques fall back to a raw-pointer alias.
- **FFI move-out-of-borrow errors (E0507)**: data-bearing enums (`Provider`, `HtmlTheme`, `PdfBackend`, `NodeContent`, `OcrBoundingGeometry`, etc.) are not Copy; previous codegen emitted `Box::new(obj.field)` (no clone), causing E0507. Now correctly emits `.clone()` when `is_clone && !is_copy`.
- **FFI let_and_return in vtable wrappers**: infallible primitive/Duration vtable returns previously emitted `let _rc = unsafe { fp(args) }; _rc`, tripping `clippy::let_and_return`. Skip the binding for that case and emit `unsafe { fp(args) }` as the tail expression.
- **FFI useless conversion in PathBuf::from on Option<PathBuf>**: codegen unconditionally wrapped `cache_dir_rs.map(std::path::PathBuf::from)` even when `cache_dir_rs` was already `Option<PathBuf>`. Now passes through directly.
- **PHP plugin bridge clippy cleanup**: 33 lint errors eliminated across `alef-backend-php`'s trait bridge generator — `let_and_return` in async wrappers, `clone_on_copy` on `*mut _zend_object` (raw ptr is Copy), `useless_conversion` on `&str`/`PhpException` self-conversions, `vec_init_then_push` replaced with `vec![…]` literals, and a duplicate `let texts = texts;` redundant local.
- **Rustler/Elixir useless `.into()`**: NIF function wrappers no longer wrap owned `String` / `Vec<u8>` returns in `.into()` (which clippy flags as `String → String` / `Vec<u8> → Vec<u8>` identity). The `gen_rustler_wrap_return` helper now consults `returns_ref` to decide.
- **Rustler reserved Elixir attribute names**: emitted GenServer modules no longer use Elixir-reserved module-attribute names (`@behaviour`, `@callback`, etc.), preventing `mix compile` errors.
- **Rustler/Go/scaffold misc**: Elixir builtins handling fix, Go cbindgen prefix correction for re-exported types, Cargo `tokio` dep added when async functions are present.
- **Rustler test fixture**: `EnumVariant` test data updated for the new `is_tuple` field added in v0.8.0.
- **PyO3 / WASM static method wrappers**: `wrap_return_with_mutex` now wraps the inner core type in the binding wrapper for `default()` / `from()` static methods on non-opaque types (was previously skipping the conversion via the broken `n == type_name` shortcut, producing 24 `mismatched types` errors in PyO3).
- **PyO3 useless `.into()` on owned String returns**: `wrap_return` in the shared serde path no longer emits `.into()` for `TypeRef::String | TypeRef::Bytes` (both are identity in all backends). Eliminates `.map(Into::into)` chains on `Result<String, _>` returns in generated PyO3 functions like `reduce_tokens`, `serialize_to_toon`, `serialize_to_json`.
- **`useless_conversion` on extracted `From<X> for Y` static methods**: kreuzberg's `From<html_to_markdown_rs::HtmlMetadata> for HtmlMetadata` impl is extracted as a static method on `HtmlMetadata` whose param type is normalized to `Self`. The generated FFI/PyO3 wrapper calls `Y::from(arg: Y)`, which Rust resolves to the blanket `From<T> for T` (identity). The wrapper is preserved for ABI stability; `clippy::useless_conversion` is suppressed at the FFI and PyO3 file level.
- **C# nullable double-coalesce**: visitor field accessors emitted `x?.Property ?? null ?? defaultValue` on already-nullable types. The redundant `?? null` is now dropped.
- **C# Name property on visitor interface**: `IVisitor` was missing the `Name` property on some codegen paths; now always emitted so trait bridge dispatch works.
- **C# csproj scaffolding**: `Kreuzberg.csproj` is scaffolded once into the package subdir (not the language root) and not overwritten on subsequent runs. User-tuned project settings (target framework, package metadata) survive regeneration.
- **Elixir NIF Cargo.toml**: emits `[workspace]` block so the NIF crate is its own cargo workspace, plus `futures-util` dep for the async bridge dispatch path.
- **Java primitive trait method parameters**: trait bridges now correctly box primitives (`int` → `Integer`, `bool` → `Boolean`) before passing through `Object[]` callbacks; primitive return values are unboxed via `.intValue()` / `.booleanValue()` rather than direct cast.
- **Magnus tagged-union `Vec<Named>` field marshalling**: Vec-of-Named fields preserve `Vec<Named>` type in generated Rust enum variants instead of collapsing to `String`. JSON array round-trip now works for tagged unions like `Multi(Vec<Item>)`. Map fields still collapse to `String` for serde_json indirection.
- **Magnus Option<T> double-wrap in kwargs**: kwargs builders no longer emit `Option<Option<T>>` for nullable struct fields when the field type is already `Option<T>` and the kwarg flag also makes it optional. Single-Option emission across kwargs and getters.
- **Go/WASM NodeContext cbindgen prefix**: cbindgen-emitted C struct names use the configured crate prefix (e.g. `KZBNodeContext` instead of `NodeContext`), matching the declared FFI symbol convention.
- **Go binding `futures-util` dep**: generated Go FFI's `Cargo.toml` declares `futures-util` when the IR exposes async functions.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-26

This release closes a long-standing gap in alef's polyglot generator: bindings for every supported language now compile cleanly with zero errors and zero warnings against real-world Rust crates that exercise trait bridges, tagged-union enums, async functions, and feature-gated modules. Most of the surface area changes are codegen-internal — public APIs are unchanged — but the cumulative effect is that downstream projects (Kreuzberg in particular) can now consume alef-emitted code without any post-generation patching across Java, C#, Go, Ruby, Elixir, R, WASM, and the previously-stable Python/Node/PHP/FFI bindings.

### Added

- **Trait bridges (Java, C#, Magnus/Ruby)**: full plugin-style register/unregister codegen with proper FFI-side vtable struct names and method dispatch. Previously gated behind `exclude_languages = ["..."]` per-bridge; the generated code is now compile-clean across all backends.
- **Trait bridges (Rustler/Elixir)**: new `LocalPid`-based dispatch using `OwnedEnv::send_and_clear` plus a global oneshot reply registry (`TRAIT_REPLY_COUNTER`, `TRAIT_REPLY_CHANNELS`) for synchronous and asynchronous trait method calls. The `alef-scaffold` Elixir generator emits a companion GenServer module per trait so consumer code can `use` the bridge directly.
- **Auto-format**: `alef generate` now runs the language-native formatter (`ruff format`, `mix format`, `cargo fmt`, `biome format --write`, `gofmt -w`, `php-cs-fixer fix`, `dotnet format`, `google-java-format -i`) on the emitted output by default. `--no-format` opts out. Per-language overrides via `[format.<lang>]` in `alef.toml`.
- **Setup timeouts**: `alef setup` accepts `--timeout <seconds>` (default 600 per language). Per-language `timeout_seconds` settable via `[setup.<lang>]` in `alef.toml`. Hangs in tooling that ignores Ctrl-C now fail cleanly via `try_wait` deadline + `child.kill`.
- **Sync-versions (RubyGems prerelease format)**: `alef sync-versions` now writes Bundler-canonical prerelease strings (`1.8.0-rc.2` → `1.8.0.pre.rc.2`) to gemspecs and `version.rb` files. Previously emitted SemVer dashes were rejected by RubyGems.
- **Sync-versions (README regeneration)**: after manifest updates, alef extracts current IR and regenerates per-language READMEs so embedded version strings (e.g. `<version>1.8.0</version>` in pom.xml snippets) refresh without a separate `alef readme` invocation.
- **Sync-versions (cache invalidation)**: removes `.alef/` after manifest updates so subsequent generation steps see fresh IR.
- **Publish `after` hooks**: `[publish.<lang>] after = "..."` is now executed at the success-path end of `prepare`, `build`, and `package` stages, mirroring the existing `before`/`precondition` hook contract. The `after` field on `PublishLanguageConfig` was previously dead config.
- **Feature-gated extraction**: `alef-extract` now captures `#[cfg(feature = "...")]` annotations on `pub use` re-exports and `pub mod` declarations, propagating the cfg to all re-exported items.
- **WASM feature filtering**: `alef-backend-wasm` reads enabled feature flags from `alef.toml` and automatically excludes types/functions/enums whose cfg references a disabled feature, preventing broken references like `ServerConfig` (gated behind `api`) from leaking into the WASM crate.
- **Orphan file cleanup**: after `alef generate` writes the current binding output, alef scans the per-language output directories for files containing the alef-generated header that are not in the current run's emission set, and deletes them. Prevents stale alef-emitted files from blocking builds when types are removed from the public Rust API.
- **Magnus tuple variant codegen**: tagged-union enum variants like `Multiple(Vec<String>)` now emit valid `Multiple(Vec<String>)` Rust syntax. Previously emitted invalid `Multiple { _0: ... }` struct-style braces.
- **FFI enum from_json/free**: enums that flow through FFI as opaque pointer parameters now get `*_from_json` and `*_free` exports so backends (C#, Java, etc.) can construct enum values across the FFI boundary.
- **C# Directory.Build.props**: emitted on every `alef generate` (always overwritten) with `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` and `<LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>`. MSBuild auto-imports it from the package directory so the setting survives user edits to `Kreuzberg.csproj`.

### Changed

- **Magnus serde marshalling for tagged-union enum fields**: `Vec<Item>` (where `Item` is a Named type) is now emitted as `Vec<Item>` in the generated Rust enum — preserving JSON array round-trip — instead of being collapsed to `String`. Map fields still collapse to `String` for serde_json indirection. Vec of primitives stays `Vec<T>`.
- **Java facade Optional unwrap**: facade methods declared with non-Optional return types (e.g. `String getPreset(...)`) now call `.orElseThrow()` on FFI results that come back as `Optional<T>`, eliminating the type mismatch between the facade and the Panama FFM layer.
- **C# wrapper `result` shadowing**: emitted local `result` variables are renamed to `nativeResult` to avoid CS0136/CS0841 collisions when the wrapper method takes a parameter named `result` (e.g. `SerializeToJson(ExtractionResult result)`).
- **C# tagged-enum string defaults**: when a serde-tagged enum field maps to `string` in C#, the default is emitted as the variant's JSON tag (`"Plain"`) rather than the non-existent `string.Plain` static.
- **C# async unit returns**: `async Task` methods with unit returns no longer emit `return await Task.Run(() => …);` — the `return` is dropped to satisfy CS1997.
- **Go trait_bridges.go**: now generated independently of the `visitor_callbacks` flag so plugin-style bridges work without enabling visitor codegen. The vtable struct name uses cbindgen's `{CRATE_UPPER}{CratePascal}{TraitPascal}VTable` convention; register/unregister calls use `{prefix}_register_{trait_snake}` / `{prefix}_unregister_{trait_snake}`. Function pointer fields are now wrapped via `(*[0]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(C.export))` so cgo treats them as C function pointer types. JSON-decoded `interface{}` parameters are type-asserted to `map[string]interface{}` before being handed to the impl method. `bool` parameters are converted to `C.uchar` via a conditional rather than direct cast.
- **C# stale-visitor cleanup**: when `visitor_callbacks = false`, alef now deletes `IVisitor.cs`, `VisitorCallbacks.cs`, `NodeContext.cs`, and `VisitResult.cs` from the output dir if they remain from a prior run.
- **Hash injection (XML)**: `alef_core::hash::inject_hash_line` now correctly handles `<!-- … -->` comment style for XML/csproj files; `pipeline::write_files` and `pipeline::diff_files` respect the per-file `generated_header` flag rather than always assuming Rust line comments.
- **alef-cli helpers**: `run_command_captured_with_timeout` uses a deadline-driven `try_wait` poll loop to enforce setup timeouts without adding new dependencies.

### Fixed

- **Magnus**: emits `Vec<T>` and `Map<K,V>` as their actual JSON-shaped types in serde-marshalled enum variants. Collapsing to bare `String` previously broke deserialization of tagged-union variants like `StopSequence::Multiple(Vec<String>)`.
- **Magnus**: deprecated `magnus::value::qnil()` and `magnus::RString::new()` API calls replaced with `Ruby::qnil()` / `Ruby::str_new` in trait bridge and binding emit. Crate-level inner attributes silence the remaining cosmetic warnings.
- **Java**: `gen_facade_class` now wraps FFI Optional returns with `.orElseThrow()` for non-Optional facade signatures (`getPreset`, `detectLanguages`).
- **Java**: `*_TO_JSON` symbol duplicates in `NativeLib.java` are deduplicated via a tracking set, mirroring the existing `_from_json` and `_free` dedup paths.
- **Java**: output-path doubling fixed when `output.java` already contains the `dev/<group>/` prefix.
- **C#**: `_vtable` field promoted to `internal` so cross-class dispatch from the wrapper compiles.
- **C#**: `sizeof(IntPtr)` replaced with the const `IntPtr.Size` so the call site no longer requires `unsafe`.
- **C#**: `bool` parameters cast to `int` (`(arg ? 1 : 0)`) at FFI call sites.
- **C#**: F32 default values emit the `f` suffix; F64 emits the `d` suffix where required for unambiguous typing.
- **C# scaffold**: removed `<NoWarn>` suppression — every generated `.cs` file now has `#nullable enable` and the project enables nullable reference types via `Directory.Build.props`.
- **Rustler**: trait bridge dispatch was previously stubbed; now wired to the reply registry with proper error_constructor template substitution. Atom creation uses `rustler::types::atom::ok()` (the previous `Env::new()` call did not exist).
- **Rustler**: error constructor template now substituted (`{msg}`) into `Err(...)` paths in both sync and async method bodies.
- **CLI**: `alef sync-versions` now updates `packages/ruby/lib/{gem}/version.rb` files in addition to gemspec/pyproject/package.json/pom.xml, completing the previously-incomplete Ruby version sync.
- **e2e/rust**: dropped the unconditional `[workspace]` block from generated `e2e/rust/Cargo.toml`. Parent workspace `[workspace.exclude]` now governs whether cargo trips on two-workspace-roots.
- **Go visitor.go**: regenerated visitor.go now compiles (`HTMHtmNodeContext`/`goVisitText` errors fixed at the alef-backend-go source).
- **Setup pipeline**: closure no longer fights `?`-propagation against rayon's parallel iterator; setup errors now surface with proper context.
- **alef-cli**: setup timeouts now actually kill the spawned process group on deadline rather than logging a spurious "skeleton" error.

### Removed

- C# scaffold no longer emits `<NoWarn>CS1591,CS8618,CS0168,CS0219,CS8625,CS0414,CS8632,CS8866</NoWarn>`. All formerly-suppressed warnings are now fixed at codegen.

## [0.7.11] - 2026-04-26

### Changed

- **E2E**: bump pinned `vitest` in generated TypeScript and WASM `package.json` from `^3.0.0` to `^4.1.5`, matching the version dependabot already pulls into the alef repo's own e2e lockfile.
- **Codegen/Scaffold**: all hardcoded third-party dependency version strings used in scaffold and e2e templates are centralized in `alef_core::template_versions` (110 constants grouped by ecosystem: npm, cargo, maven, gem, packagist, nuget, hex, pypi, cran, precommit). Each const that should auto-bump is annotated with a `// renovate: datasource=...` marker, and a new `renovate.json` at the repo root wires up the custom regex manager so Renovate can open version-bump PRs. Pure refactor — no value changes.
- **Tooling**: `task set-version` now targets the centralized `ALEF_REV` constant in `crates/alef-core/src/template_versions.rs` instead of the stale path in `precommit.rs`.

### Fixed

- **Update**: `alef update --latest` no longer hangs when Node and Wasm are both configured. Commands shared across multiple language default configs (e.g. `pnpm up --latest -r -w`) are now deduplicated — only the first language claiming a command runs it, preventing pnpm lockfile races under parallel execution.
- **Update**: R `upgrade` command now passes `ask = FALSE` to `remotes::update_packages()`, preventing an interactive prompt that blocked the non-interactive runner.
- **E2E (Python)**: skip-reason strings on generated `@pytest.mark.skip` decorators are now escaped before interpolation, so reasons containing quotes or backslashes no longer produce syntactically invalid Python test files.

### Removed

- **Hooks**: `alef-fmt` and `alef-lint` pre-commit hooks. Both used `pass_filenames: false` with a broad `files:` regex, so any matching commit cold-started every configured language toolchain (mvn, dotnet, mypy, etc.) regardless of which file changed — making the hooks unusably slow. The `alef fmt` and `alef lint` CLI commands are unchanged. Scaffold's generated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` no longer emits the removed hook ids.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Validation**: redundant-default warnings no longer fire for `precondition` fields when the section has custom main commands (format/check/typecheck/command/e2e). Previously, `alef verify` would warn to remove the precondition while simultaneously requiring it — a contradiction.
- **Verify**: legacy README comparison now normalizes whitespace before hashing, preventing false-positive "stale bindings" reports from trailing-space or blank-line differences.

## [0.7.9] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Backends**: Kotlin/JVM backend (`alef-backend-kotlin`) — emits `data class` for IR structs, `enum class` / `sealed class` for IR enums, and an `object` wrapping top-level functions. Consumes the same Java/Panama FFM `.so` produced by the Java backend. Function bodies are `TODO()` stubs; FFI bridge wiring lands in Phase 1C. Kotlin/Native and Multiplatform paths deferred to Phase 3.
- **Backends**: Gleam backend (`alef-backend-gleam`) — emits `pub type Foo { Foo(field: T, ...) }` records and `@external(erlang, "<nif>", "<fn>")` declarations targeting the Rustler-emitted Erlang NIF. No new Rust crate generated; Gleam shims an existing Rustler NIF library.
- **Backends**: Zig backend (`alef-backend-zig`) — emits `pub const T = struct {}` types, `pub const E = enum {}` / `union(enum)` enums, and thin wrappers calling into the C ABI via `pub const c = @cImport(@cInclude("<header>.h"))`. Marshalling for non-trivial return types lands in Phase 1C.
- **Core**: `BuildDependency` enum (`None | Ffi | Rustler`) replaces `BuildConfig.depends_on_ffi: bool`. All 11 existing backends migrated; `BuildConfig::depends_on_ffi()` accessor preserved for callers.
- **Core**: `PostBuildStep::RunCommand { cmd, args }` variant — needed by Phase 2 Dart's flutter_rust_bridge codegen step.
- **Core**: Five new `Language` enum variants — `Kotlin`, `Swift`, `Dart`, `Gleam`, `Zig`. All per-language match arms across `crates/alef-core/src/config/` (build/clean/lint/setup/test/update defaults, naming, scaffold, publish, docs, adapters) wired with sensible defaults. `Swift` and `Dart` panic in the registry pending Phase 2.
- **CLI**: `alef verify` now checks README freshness — regenerated READMEs are compared with on-disk files.
- **Hooks**: `alef-readme` pre-commit hook to regenerate README files for all configured languages.
- **Scaffold**: scaffolded `.pre-commit-config.yaml` includes `alef-readme` hook.
- **Config**: top-level `[tools]` section selects per-language tool variants — `python_package_manager` (uv | pip | poetry), `node_package_manager` (pnpm | npm | yarn), and `rust_dev_tools` (list of `cargo install` targets). Per-language pipeline defaults dispatch on these choices.
- **Pipelines**: every per-language default (lint, test, build, setup, update, clean) now declares a POSIX `command -v <tool>` precondition so steps gracefully warn-and-skip when the underlying tool is missing on the user's system.
- **Setup**: Rust `setup` default now installs the full polyrepo dev-tool set — `cargo-edit`, `cargo-sort`, `cargo-machete`, `cargo-deny`, `cargo-llvm-cov` — plus `rustfmt` and `clippy` rustup components. The list is overridable via `[tools].rust_dev_tools`.
- **Init**: `alef init` emits a commented `[tools]` block in the generated `alef.toml` with all alternatives documented.
- **Validation**: `alef.toml` is validated at load time. Custom `[lint|test|build_commands|setup|update|clean].<lang>` tables that override a main command field must declare a `precondition` so the warn-and-skip behavior is preserved on user systems.
- **Scaffold**: FFI Cargo.toml gains a `[dev-dependencies]` block with `tempfile`. Dependency pins audited and policy documented.
- **Config**: per-language `run_wrapper`, `extra_lint_paths`, and `project_file` knobs reduce override boilerplate. `[python] run_wrapper = "uv run --no-sync"` prefixes default tool invocations across lint and test; `[python] extra_lint_paths = ["scripts"]` appends paths to default lint commands; `[csharp] project_file = "Foo.csproj"` (and `[java] project_file = "pom.xml"`) makes default lint/test/build commands target the file instead of the package directory. Each absorbs a common override pattern observed in consumer repos without forcing a full `[lint.<lang>]` redefinition.
- **Validation**: `alef.toml` is now scanned for redundant defaults at load time. When a user-supplied `[lint|test|build_commands|setup|update|clean].<lang>` field equals the built-in default verbatim, alef emits a `tracing::warn!` naming the section and field so users can keep the file minimal.

### Changed

- **Pipelines**: `default_*_config` functions now take a `&LangContext` argument bundling `&ToolsConfig`, `run_wrapper`, `extra_lint_paths`, and `project_file` — replacing the prior `&ToolsConfig`-only signature so per-language defaults can dispatch on every relevant knob.
- **Generate**: post-generation formatting is now best-effort. `alef generate` (and `alef all`) call a new `fmt_post_generate` that swallows three classes of post-gen formatter trouble — a missing tool (precondition miss → "Skipping" warning, language skipped), a failing `before` hook (warning, language skipped), and a non-zero formatter exit (warning, formatter loop continues). Formatters are *expected* to modify generated files, so non-zero exits there must not abort the run. The explicit `alef fmt` command keeps strict failure semantics.

### Fixed

- **Python**: classify enum imports correctly in generated `api.py` — data enums (tagged unions) and enums not referenced by `has_default` config structs now import from the native module instead of `options.py`, fixing missing-attribute errors at runtime.
- **Python**: emit converter locals in required-first, optional-last order so positional calls to the native function match the pyo3 signature.
- **Python**: generate runtime conversion for data-enum and `has_default` parameters in `api.py` wrappers, including `Vec<…>` and `Optional<Vec<…>>` shapes — list comprehensions are emitted to coerce each element. Previously only scalar (`Named` / `Optional<Named>`) parameters were converted, leaving collection parameters silently un-coerced.
- **Performance (pyo3)**: maintain a parallel `AHashSet` for the opaque-types transitive-closure dedupe check, restoring O(1) membership testing in the hot loop.

## [0.7.8] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **Codegen**: extract shared trait bridge helpers (`bridge_param_type`, `visitor_param_type`, `prim`, `find_bridge_param`, `to_camel_case`) into `alef-codegen::generators::trait_bridge`, removing ~600 lines of duplication across 7 backend crates.
- **Codegen**: remove duplicate `format_type_ref` from extendr backend in favor of the shared implementation.
- **Codegen**: consolidate `PYTHON_KEYWORDS` constant — delete duplicate from `alef-codegen::generators::enums`, import from `alef-core::keywords`.
- **E2E**: extract shared `resolve_field()` helper from `rust.rs` and `python.rs` into `codegen/mod.rs`.

### Fixed

- **Codegen**: avoid redundant `.into()` on owned String/Bytes return values in generated bindings.
- **Codegen**: use `to_string_lossy()` for Path return values in generated method wrappers.
- **Codegen**: optimize generated `.map(|val| val.into())` to `.map(Into::into)` in function/method wrappers.
- **Go**: skip functions/methods that use enum types lacking FFI JSON helpers (`_from_json`/`_to_json`/`_free`).
- **Go**: respect `exclude_functions` from FFI config when generating Go bindings.
- **Go**: fix `visitor_callbacks` in trait bridge test config.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Config**: top-level `version` field in `alef.toml` to pin the alef CLI version per project. `alef init` now emits this field automatically.
- **Install action**: `install-alef` reads the pinned version from `alef.toml` when input is `"latest"`, falling back to the latest GitHub release if not specified.

### Fixed

- **Config**: use top-level `version` key instead of `[alef]` section to avoid TOML scoping issues where subsequent keys were captured inside the section.
- **Python bindings**: sanitize doc strings with `sanitize_python_doc()` consistently across all generated code (options enums, dataclasses, TypedDict, API functions, exceptions) to prevent ruff RUF001/RUF002 lint errors.
- **Python stubs**: fix test assertions for builtin-shadowing parameter names (`input`, `id`) that now generate multi-line signatures with `# noqa: A002`.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Config**: `[alef]` section in `alef.toml` with `version` field to pin the alef CLI version per project (superseded by top-level `version` in 0.7.7).

### Fixed

- **Python bindings**: sanitize doc strings with `sanitize_python_doc()` consistently across all generated code.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Codegen**: suppress `clippy::redundant_closure` and `clippy::useless_conversion` lints in generated `From` impl blocks.
- **Python bindings**: add `noqa` comments to generated `typing` imports.
- **Python bindings/stubs**: force multi-line function signatures when a parameter name shadows a Python builtin (e.g. `id`, `type`, `input`), and annotate those parameters with `# noqa: A002`.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **E2E assertions**: `min_length`, `max_length`, `ends_with`, and `matches_regex` assertion types across all language codegen backends (Bash/Brew, C, C#, Elixir, Go, Java, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, WASM).

### Fixed

- **Python bindings**: prevent duplicate `| None` annotation on optional parameters whose base type already contains `| None` (e.g. `Option<Option<T>>`).
- **Python stubs**: use `ends_with("| None")` instead of `contains("| None")` for the same check in type-init, method, and function stubs.
- **Scaffold(C#)**: XML-escape author names in `.csproj` to avoid malformed XML.
- **Scaffold(Java)**: parse `"Name <email>"` author strings into separate `<name>` and `<email>` elements; XML-escape both; omit placeholder email when not provided.
- **Scaffold(PHP)**: derive Composer vendor from GitHub repository URL instead of hardcoding `kreuzberg-dev`.
- **Scaffold(Ruby)**: use double-quoted strings for gemspec authors array.
- **Scaffold**: default repository URL uses `example` org instead of `kreuzberg-dev`.
- **Elixir bindings**: escape parameter names that collide with Elixir reserved words (`do`, `end`, `fn`, etc.) by appending `_val` suffix.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Keyword-aware field renaming for Python bindings** — struct fields whose names collide with Python reserved keywords (e.g. `class`, `from`, `type`) are automatically escaped in the generated binding struct (`class_`) while preserving the original name via `#[pyo3(get, name = "class")]` and `#[serde(rename = "class")]` attributes. Configurable per-field via `rename_fields` in language configs.
- Shared keyword list in `alef-core::keywords` with `python_ident()` helper — single source of truth for Python reserved words, replacing duplicated lists in `gen_bindings.rs` and `gen_stubs.rs`.
- `ConversionConfig::binding_field_renames` for keyword-escaped field name substitution in `From`/`Into` conversion impls.
- `gen_struct_with_rename` and `gen_impl_block_with_renames` codegen generators for per-field attribute customization.
- `AlefConfig::resolve_field_name()` for config-driven field name resolution per language and type.
- Scaffold: emit `rust-toolchain.toml` (Rust 1.95) and `.cargo/config.toml` with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target for WASM projects.
- Scaffold: include WASM target in clippy pre-commit hook instead of excluding it.
- Config: `corepack up` added to Node.js update defaults; `corepack use pnpm@latest` for pnpm upgrade.

### Fixed

- Publish: derive PHP extension name from output path instead of hardcoding.
- Publish: derive crate names from output paths instead of hardcoding.
- FFI: replace deprecated `clippy::drop_ref` lint with `dropping_references`.
- Scaffold: Ruby `Rakefile` template uses correct Bundler 4 API.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **`alef publish` command group** — vendoring, building, and packaging artifacts for distribution across language package registries (issue #9).
  - `alef publish prepare` — vendors core crate (Ruby, Elixir, R) and stages FFI artifacts (Go, Java, C#).
  - `alef publish build` — cross-compilation-aware build with `--target` support, auto-selects cargo/cross/maturin/napi/wasm-pack per language.
  - `alef publish package` — creates distributable archives (C FFI tarball with pkg-config/CMake, PHP PIE archive, Go FFI tarball).
  - `alef publish validate` — checks version readability, package directory existence, and manifest file presence.
- New `alef-publish` crate with `platform::RustTarget` for parsing Rust target triples and mapping to per-language platform conventions (Go, Java, C#, Node, Ruby, Elixir).
- `[publish]` config section in `alef.toml` with per-language `vendor_mode`, `nif_versions`, `build_command`, `package_command`, `precondition`, `before` hooks, `pkg_config`, `cmake_config`.
- `vendor::vendor_core_only()` — copies core crate, rewrites Cargo.toml via `toml_edit` to inline workspace inheritance and dependency specs, removes workspace lints, generates vendor workspace manifest.
- `vendor::vendor_full()` — core-only + `cargo vendor` of all transitive deps with test/bench cleanup.
- `ffi_stage::stage_ffi()` / `stage_header()` — copies built FFI shared library and C header to language-specific directories.

### Fixed

- CLI: `alef build` now respects `[build_commands.<lang>]` overrides for non-Rust languages.
- CLI: `before` hooks in lint/fmt now fire even when a language has `check`/`typecheck` commands but no `format` commands.
- CLI: `before` hook output (stdout/stderr) is now logged instead of silently discarded.
- Config: Ruby lint defaults use `cd {output_dir} && bundle exec rubocop` instead of running from project root.
- Config: FFI lint defaults search entire output directory instead of assuming `tests/` subdirectory.
- Scaffold: pre-commit config now uses `alef-fmt` + `alef-lint` hooks instead of per-language hooks.
- Codegen(Go): local variable naming, error string conventions, enum acronym rules, `nodeTypeFromC` acronym naming, visitor doc comments, golangci scaffold config.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Config: `precondition` field on all command configs (`LintConfig`, `TestConfig`, `SetupConfig`, `UpdateConfig`, `BuildCommandConfig`, `CleanConfig`) — a shell command that must exit 0 for the main command to run; skips the language with a warning on failure.
- Config: `before` field on all command configs — command(s) that run before the main command; aborts on failure. Supports `StringOrVec` (single string or list).
- Config: `GOWORK=off` in default Go setup command to avoid workspace interference.
- Config: Maven version rules file reference in default Java update commands.
- CLI: Rust is now a first-class language in `alef build` — builds via configurable `[build_commands.rust]` instead of panicking on missing backend.
- FFI: derive `Copy` and `Clone` on generated vtable structs.

### Fixed

- FFI: trait bridge generation fixes for kreuzberg integration.

- Codegen: deduplicate `Bytes` conversion when base conversion already emits `.into()` or `.map(Into::into)`.
- Codegen: handle sanitized and excluded-type fields in enum binding-to-core match arms with `serde_json` deserialization and `Box` wrapping.
- Scaffold (Node): generate `.oxfmtrc.json` (120 printWidth, tabs, import sorting) and `.oxlintrc.json` (correctness=error, suspicious=warn, style=off, typescript+import plugins).

### Changed

- CLI: `alef init` now runs full project bootstrap — generates alef.toml, extracts API, generates bindings, scaffolds manifests, and formats in one command.
- CLI: `alef lint` refactored with `LintPhase` enum, uses `config.lint_config_for_language()` with per-language defaults instead of raw map lookup.
- CLI: `alef generate` and `alef all` use built-in `fmt` instead of prek for post-generation formatting.
- Scaffold (Node): replace Biome with Oxc toolchain — `oxfmt` + `oxlint` in package.json devDeps and scripts.

### Removed

- CLI: `run_prek()` and `run_prek_autoupdate()` — prek is no longer auto-invoked during generation. Users can still use prek independently.
